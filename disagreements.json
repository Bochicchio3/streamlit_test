    "Title": "Drug-eluting balloon angioplasty versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can lead to disabling ischemia and limb loss. Treatment modalities have included risk factor optimization through life-style modifications and medications, or operative approaches using both open and minimally invasive techniques, such as balloon angioplasty. Drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty has emerged as a promising alternative to uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of this difficult disease process. By ballooning and coating the inside of atherosclerotic vessels with cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, cellular mechanisms responsible for atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia are inhibited and its devastating complications are prevented or postponed. DEBs are considerably more expensive than uncoated balloons, and their efficacy in improving patient outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) compared with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty in people with symptomatic lower-limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched December 2015) and Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (2015, Issue 11). The TSC searched trial databases for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials that compared DEBs with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty for intermittent claudication (IC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (AK, TA) independently selected the appropriate trials and performed data extraction, assessment of trial quality, and data analysis. The senior review author (DKR) adjudicated any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials that randomized 1838 participants met the study inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials included femoropopliteal arterial lesions, three included tibial arterial lesions, and one included both. The trials were carried out in Europe and in the USA and all used the taxane drug paclitaxel in the DEB arm. Nine of the 11 trials were industry-sponsored. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices (Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic). The trials examined both anatomic and clinical endpoints. There was heterogeneity in the frequency of stent deployment and the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy between trials. Using GRADE assessment criteria, the quality of the evidence presented was moderate for the outcomes of target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category, and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle-brachial index (ABI). Most participants were followed up for 12 months, but one trial reported outcomes at five years.There were better outcomes for DEBs for up to two years in primary vessel patency (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 9.57 at six months; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56 at 12 months; OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.26 to 5.46 at two years) and at six months and two years for late lumen loss (mean difference (MD) -0.64 mm, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.28 at six months; MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.16 at two years). DEB were also superior to uncoated balloon angioplasty for up to five years in target lesion revascularization (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47 at six months; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.51 at 12 months; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44 at two years; OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.51 at five years) and binary restenosis rate (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67 at six months; OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98 at 12 months; OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66 at two years; OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.30 at five years). There was no significant difference between DEB and uncoated angioplasty in amputation, death, change in ABI, change in Rutherford category and quality of life (QoL) scores, or functional walking ability, although none of the trials were powered to detect a significant difference in these clinical endpoints. We carried out two subgroup analyses to examine outcomes in femoropopliteal and tibial interventions as well as in people with CLI (4 or greater Rutherford class), and showed no advantage for DEBs in tibial vessels at six and 12 months compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. There was also no advantage for DEBs in CLI compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty at 12 months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis of 11 trials with 1838 participants, there is evidence of an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty in several anatomic endpoints such as primary vessel patency (high-quality evidence), binary restenosis rate (moderate-quality evidence), and target lesion revascularization (low-quality evidence) for up to 12 months. Conversely, there is no evidence of an advantage for DEBs in clinical endpoints such as amputation, death, or change in ABI, or change in Rutherford category during 12 months' follow-up. Well-designed randomized trials with long-term follow-up are needed to compare DEBs with uncoated balloon angioplasties adequately for both anatomic and clinical study endpoints before the widespread use of this expensive technology can be justified.",

    "Title": "Drug-eluting balloon angioplasty versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of in-stent restenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stents are placed in the femoropopliteal arteries for numerous reasons, such as atherosclerotic disease, the need for dissection, and perforation of the arteries, and can become stenosed with the passage of time. When a stent develops a flow-limiting stenosis, this process is known as \"in-stent stenosis.\" It is thought that in-stent restenosis is caused by a process known as \"intimal hyperplasia\" rather than by the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Management of in-stent restenosis may include performing balloon angioplasty, deploying another stent within the stenosed stent to force it open, and creating a bypass to deliver blood around the stent. The role of drug-eluting technologies, such as drug-eluting balloons (DEBs), in the management of in-stent restenosis is unclear. Drug-eluting balloons might function by coating the inside of stenosed stents with cytotoxic chemicals such as paclitaxel and by inhibiting the hyperplastic processes responsible for in-stent restenosis. It is important to perform this systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of DEB because of the potential for increased expenses associated with DEBs over uncoated balloon angioplasty, also known as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty in people with in-stent restenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries as assessed by criteria such as amputation-free survival, vessel patency, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis rate, and death. We define \"in-stent restenosis\" as 50% or greater narrowing of a previously stented vessel by duplex ultrasound or angiography. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to November 28, 2017. Review authors also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials that compared DEBs versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for treatment of in-stent restenosis in the femoropopliteal arteries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (AK, WA) independently selected appropriate trials and performed data extraction, assessment of trial quality, and data analysis. The senior review author (AD) adjudicated any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials that randomized a combined total of 263 participants met the review inclusion criteria. All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries. These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons. Two of the three trials were industry sponsored. Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany; Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA). The trials examined both anatomical and clinical endpoints. We noted heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment between studies as well as in the dosage of paclitaxel applied by the DEBs. Using GRADE assessment criteria, we determined that the certainty of evidence presented was very low for the outcomes of amputation, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis, death, and improvement of one or more Rutherford categories. Most participants were followed up to 12 months, but one trial followed participants for up to 24 months.Trial results show no difference in the incidence of amputation between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. DEBs showed better outcomes for up to 24 months for target lesion revascularization (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.92 at six months; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70 at 24 months) and at six and 12 months for binary restenosis (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56 at six months; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.76 at 12 months). Participants treated with DEBs also showed improvement of one or more Rutherford categories at six and 12 months (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.21 at six months; OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.83 at 12 months). Data show no clear differences in death between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. Data were insufficient for subgroup or sensitivity analyses to be conducted. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis of three trials with 263 participants, evidence suggests an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty for anatomical endpoints such as target lesion revascularization (TLR) and binary restenosis, and for one clinical endpoint - improvement in Rutherford category post intervention for up to 24 months. However, the certainty of evidence for all these outcomes is very low due to the small number of included studies and participants and the high risk of bias in study design. Adequately powered and carefully constructed randomized controlled trials are needed to adequately investigate the role of drug-eluting technologies in the management of in-stent restenosis.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine which primary endovascular revascularisation strategy represents the most clinically effective treatment for patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia who require endovascular femoro-popliteal, with or without infra-popliteal, revascularisation. DESIGN: Three arm, open label, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 superiority trial (BASIL-3). SETTING: 35 UK NHS vascular units. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia who required endovascular femoro-popliteal, with or without infra-popliteal, revascularisation. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to femoro-popliteal plain balloon angioplasty with or without bare metal stenting (PBA\u00b1BMS), drug coated balloon angioplasty with or without bare metal stenting (DCBA\u00b1BMS), or drug eluting stenting (DES) as their first revascularisation strategy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was amputation free survival defined as time to first major amputation or death from any cause. Secondary outcomes included the composite components of the primary outcome, major adverse limb events, major adverse cardiac events, and other prespecified clinical and patient reported outcome measures. Serious adverse events were collected up to 30 days after the first revascularisation procedure. RESULTS: Between 29 January 2016 and 31 August 2021, 481 participants were randomised (167 (35%) women, mean age 71.8 years (standard deviation 10.8)). Major amputation or death occurred in 106 of 160 (66%) participants in the PBA\u00b1BMS group, 97 of 161 (60%) in the DCBA\u00b1BMS group, and 93 of 159 (58%) in the DES group (adjusted hazard ratios: PBA\u00b1BMS v DCBA\u00b1BMS: 0.84, 97.5% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.16, P=0.22; PBA\u00b1BMS v DES: 0.83, 0.60 to 1.15, P=0.20). No differences in serious adverse events were reported between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neither DCBA\u00b1BMS nor DES conferred significant clinical benefit over PBA\u00b1BMS in the femoro-popliteal segment in patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia undergoing endovascular femoro-popliteal, with or without infra-popliteal, revascularisation.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 5-year follow-up (FU) data of the THUNDER (Local Taxan With Short Time Contact for Reduction of Restenosis in Distal Arteries). BACKGROUND: The THUNDER trial was the first study to investigate the treatment of femoropopliteal arteries with a paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB). METHODS: In 154 patients, femoropopliteal arteries were treated with PCB, with angioplasty with paclitaxel in contrast medium, or no paclitaxel (control). The primary endpoint was 6-month late lumen loss (LLL). Secondary endpoints included freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), binary restenosis rate, and amputation. The 5-year FU compares outcomes in patients treated with PCB and control subjects. Additionally, LLL at 6 months and TLR up to 5-year FU were analyzed in terms of sex and lesion length. RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, the cumulative number of patients with TLR remained significantly lower in the PCB group (21%) than in the control group (56%, p = 0.0005). In the small group of patients with angiographic and duplex sonographic follow-up, PCB was associated with a lower rate of binary restenosis (17% vs. 54%; p = 0.04). No signs of aneurysm formation or constrictive fibrosis were detected. Whereas LLL at 6-month FU did not differ between men and women in the PCB group, the TLR rate was lower in men than in women at 5-year FU. A benefit of PCB treatment in terms of LLL and TLR was seen independent of lesion length. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced TLR rate following PCB treatment was maintained over the 5-year FU period. No signs of drug-related local vessel abnormalities were detected. (Thunder Trial-Local Taxan With Short Time Contact for Reduction of Restenosis in Distal Arteries [THUNDER]; NCT00156624).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions are challenging to treat, and evidence of the effectiveness of drug-coated balloon angioplasty for long femoropopliteal chronic total occlusion lesions is limited. We compared the midterm outcomes of drug-coated balloon angioplasty versus plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) for femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions. METHODS: In total, 95 patients from the AcoArt I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01850056) with \u22655-cm femoropopliteal chronic total occlusion lesions were enrolled in this post-hoc subset analysis (drug-coated balloon, n\u2009=\u200950; POBA, n\u2009=\u200945). The primary endpoints were primary patency and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 24\u2009months. The secondary endpoints were late lumen loss at six\u2009months and binary restenosis, major adverse events (composite of death and target limb amputation), change in the Rutherford class, and the ankle-brachial index at 24\u2009months. RESULTS: Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched (mean lesion length, 20\u2009cm). The six-month late-lumen loss rate was lower in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.81 vs. 1.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94\u2009mm, respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The 24-month primary patency rate was significantly higher in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (53.85% vs. 17.50%, respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The CD-TLR rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77 and 45.24%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.002). The 24-month overall mortality rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77% and 6.98%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.360), with no device- or procedure-related deaths. One major amputation had occurred in each group by the 24-month follow-up.

METHODS: From September 2010 to March 2011, 50 patients were randomized between drug eluting balloon (DEB, N.=25) and conventional angioplasty balloon (PTA, N.=25). Patients were symptomatic for claudication and critical limb ischemia, with de novo stenosis or occlusion in the femoropopliteal (SFA) and infrapopliteal (BTK) region. Only in the SFA primary stenting was allowed and postdilatation performed with DEB or PTA depending on the assigned group. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two lesions were treated: 92 (75.4%) SFA, 30 (24.6%) BTK. Twenty (40%) patients presented multilevel concomitant femoropopliteal and infra-popliteal lesions. Late lumen loss (LLL) was 0.64\u00b10.9 mm in DEB group vs. 1.81\u00b10.1 mm in the control group (P=0.01). In non-stented segment LLL was 0.63\u00b10.9 mm (DEB) vs. 1.70\u00b10.6 mm (PTA), P<0.01. In the stent subgroup was LLL 0.65\u00b10.2 mm (DEB) vs. 1.91\u00b10.3 mm (PTA), P<0.01. In the femoropopliteal region the overall LLL was 0.61\u00b10.8 mm for DEB vs. 1.84\u00b10.3 mm for PTA (P=0.02). BTK the overall LLL was 0.66\u00b10.9 mm (DEB) vs. 1.69\u00b10.5 mm (PTA) (P=0.03). The overall TLR was 12.2% for DEB and 35.3% for PTA (P<0.05). Amputation rate was 4% (DEB) vs. 12% (PTA), P=0.36. Thrombosis was 4% (DEB) vs. 8% (PTA), P\u22650.05.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcomes after drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty dissection in patients with complex femoropopliteal artery disease. METHODS: Two hundred patients with femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease were enrolled in the AcoArt I trial and randomly assigned to either the DCB or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) group. A total of 86 patients with post-balloon angioplasty dissection were reanalyzed. The primary endpoint was clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) over five years. Kaplan-Meier curve estimates were used to evaluate the association between the treatment and CD-TLR. Interaction and stratified analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Over five years, patients treated with DCB angioplasty demonstrated an acceptable effect with a numerically higher but not statistically significant rate of freedom from CD-TLR compared with those treated by PTA (Kaplan-Meier estimate of 77.6% vs 64.4%; log-rank P = 0.08). Among the patients who underwent TLR, the mean time from intervention to TLR in the DCB group was significantly prolonged compared to the PTA group (P < 0.001). The stratified analysis showed that the Rutherford classification played an interactive role in the association between the DCB angioplasty and low CD-TLR rate at five years. No significant difference in the all-cause mortality was found in the patients with post-balloon angioplasty dissection between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The five-year follow-up outcomes of the post-balloon angioplasty dissection in the AcoArt I trial demonstrated that DCB angioplasty is more trustworthy than PTA, with a higher rate of freedom than CD-TLR and sustained improvement in clinical symptoms.

To address long-term safety, sites were requested to obtain vital status follow-up. In the pooled, updated data set, we examined the association between randomized treatment and mortality by cumulative incidence and hazard ratio (HR), and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Multivariable Cox regression with adjustment for baseline characteristics was used to evaluate the dose effect. Causes of death were adjudicated by a blinded clinical events committee that included oncologists with paclitaxel expertise. RESULTS: The rate of long-term vital status ascertainment increased from 81% to 97% for DCB and from 85% to 97% for PTA in the IN.PACT SFA trial. The cumulative incidence of mortality was 14.7% DCB versus 12.0% PTA at 5\u2009years, HR 1.39, log-rank p =\u2009.286. Paclitaxel dose (mg) was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.02, p =\u2009.381), but was an independent predictor of reduced risk of CD-TLR (HR 0.79; p <\u2009.001). Causes of death did not differ by treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In pooled randomized trial data with updated vital status ascertainment, paclitaxel was associated with improved efficacy but was not associated with increased mortality.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate sex-related disparities in long-term outcomes of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) treated with IN.PACT drug-coated balloon (DCB) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the IN.PACT SFA trial was performed. Participants with Rutherford Clinical Classification 2-4 PAD and femoropopliteal artery lesions up to 18 cm long were randomly assigned to treatment with DCB (n\u00a0= 220) or PTA (n\u00a0= 111). Effectiveness outcomes were evaluated, including 36-month primary patency (freedom from binary restenosis and freedom from clinically driven [CD] target lesion revascularization [TLR]). RESULTS: In the DCB group, women were significantly older (69.4 y \u00b1 9.9) than men (66.4 y \u00b1 9.1; P\u00a0= .025). Mean reference vessel diameter (RVD) was significantly smaller in women (4.4 mm \u00b1 0.68) compared with men (4.8 mm \u00b1 0.89, P < .001). Primary patency was 65.4% in women and 71.8% in men (P\u00a0= .302). Freedom from CD-TLR was 81.1% in women and 86.4% in men (P\u00a0= .285). Women treated with PTA were older (70.4 y \u00b1 8.3) than men (66.9 y \u00b1 9.5; P\u00a0= .063). Mean RVD was significantly smaller in women (4.2 mm \u00b1 0.77) compared with men (4.9 mm \u00b1 0.77, P < .001). Primary patency was 42.3% in women and 46.7% in men (P\u00a0= .551). Freedom from CD-TLR was 59.4% in women and 75.5% in men (P\u00a0= .109). No significant differences were noted in safety and mortality outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In both groups, women were older and had smaller vessels. Particularly in the PTA group, women had worse clinical outcomes, though not reaching statistical significance. Further evaluation is necessary to understand the disparate nature of disease progression and outcomes following endovascular treatment in women compared with men.",

    "Title": "Outcomes and Comparative Analysis of the Initial Results of Standard Balloon Angioplasty Versus Drug-Coated Balloons Alone Versus in Association With Laser-Excimer Atherectomy in the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Artery In-Stent Restenosis (INTACT).",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite improved patency with newer-generation nitinol stents, one-half of patients will require secondary interventions for in-stent restenosis (ISR). The best treatment strategy remains unclear. This study aimed to compare drug-coated balloons (DCBs) used alone or in association with excimer laser atherectomy (ELA) to simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of femoropopliteal-ISR. METHODS: The INTACT trial is a multicenter, prospective, triple-arm randomized trial conducted across 14 centers from December 2015 to November 2019. Patients Rutherford Class 2-5 with ISR\u226570% were followed-up for 18 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent ISR>70% by duplex ultrasound analysis. The primary safety endpoint was major adverse events (MAEs) defined as death, major amputation, or target lesion revascularization (TLR). RESULTS: Around 134 subjects were randomized to PTA alone (n=41), PTA+DCB (n=43) or PTA+ELA+DCB (n=50). Procedural success was similar (p=.74), as was clinical success (p=.17). The number of recurrent ISR>70% decreased after PTA+ELA+DCB (30.0%; p=.04) and PTA+DCB (30.2%; p=.05) compared to PTA alone (51.2%). Primary patency was higher after PTA+ELA+DCB (log-rank p=.04) and PTA+DCB (log-rank p=.02) compared to PTA alone at 12 months (78.7% and 70.4% vs 61.5%) and 18 months (61.6% and 67.7% vs 37.3%). Freedom from MAEs was lower after PTA+DCB (27.9%) compared to PTA alone (53.7%; p=.02) but did not differ with PTA+ELA+DCB (40.0%). It was primarily driven by TLR; 2 major amputations occurred after PTA+ELA+DCB (4.0%; p=.18). CONCLUSION: This independent study demonstrated a decrease in recurrent ISR>70% and increase in primary patency up to 18 months after PTA+ELA+DCB and PTA+DCB compared to PTA alone in the treatment of FP-ISR. It did not show an increase in MAEs but could have lacked power. CLINICAL IMPACT: This multicenter, prospective, triple-arm randomized, controlled trial focuses on the results of adjunctive therapies, such as excimer laser atherectomy (ELA) and/or drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in femoropopliteal lesions in 134 patients. It has the originality of being an independent study funded by a grant from the French Ministry of Health. This study confirms a significant decrease in recurrent ISR >70% and increase in primary patency up to 18 months after the use of ELA+DCB and DCBs compared to simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of femoropopliteal ISR without an increase in major adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between post-balloon angioplasty dissection and the mid-term results of the AcoArt I trial evaluating complex femoropopliteal artery disease. METHODS: The outcome data for 144 patients from the AcoArt 1 trial were reanalysed. These patients were randomly divided into percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and drug-coated balloons (DCB) groups. The primary endpoint was the primary patency (PP) rate and clinically-driven target lesion revascularisation at 24 months. RESULTS: After 24 months of follow-up, the PP rate of dissection cases in the PTA group was lower vs non-dissection cases. In patients receiving a bailout stent for dissection, the PP rate in the PTA group was lower vs the DCB group. Cox regression analysis showed that dissection decreased the PP rate; mild dissection reduced the PP rate as follows: 52%, PTA group and 19%, DCB group. With severe dissection, the PP rate reduction was as follows: 75%, PTA group and 73%, DCB group. CONCLUSIONS: The mid-term follow-up showed that post-balloon angioplasty dissection reduced the PP rate in the PTA group but not in the DCB group. Additionally, in patients receiving a bailout stent for dissection, the DCB group had a better PP rate than the PTA group.",

METHODS: In the prospective, randomized, controlled EffPac study, patients were allocated to either DCB or plain old balloon angioplasty. Multivariable regression including interaction analysis was conducted to assess the impact of selected variables on the outcome measures of late lumen loss (LLL) at 6\u00a0months, and on binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), clinical improvement, and hemodynamic improvement at 12\u00a0months. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients (69\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0years, 111 men) were treated at 11 German centers. Hypertension increased, and advanced age decreased LLL (B coefficient [B]: 0.7 [95% CI -\u20090.04 to 1.3], p\u2009=\u20090.06 and -\u20090.3 per 10\u00a0years [95% CI -\u20090.5 to 0.01], p\u2009=\u20090.06, respectively). DCB angioplasty decreased odds of 12-month TLR and binary restenosis (OR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8], p\u2009=\u20090.01 and OR 0.1 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.6], p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). Lesion length and severe calcification decreased clinical improvement (B: -\u20090.1 per 10\u00a0mm [95% CI -\u20090.1 to -\u20090.03], p\u2009=\u20090.001 and -\u20090.1 [95% CI -\u20091.7 to -\u20090.1], p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). DCB angioplasty in former smokers improved ABI (0.2 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.5], p\u2009=\u20090.04). CONCLUSION: DCB angioplasty decreased the incidence of 12-month restenosis and TLR. Increasing lesion length and severe calcification reduced clinical improvement. Hypertension is suspected to facilitate, and advanced age to mitigate LLL. DCB improved ABI most in former smokers.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and sustainability of drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR). Materials and Methods: An investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized study enrolled 88 patients for treatment of ISR with DCB (n=47; mean age 68.3\u00b19.6 years; 26 men) or uncoated balloon (n=41; mean age 67.6\u00b110.2 years; 26 men) angioplasty (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01594684). Additionally, the protocol provided for an observational arm composed of patients from either randomized arm who experienced recurrent ISR \u226530 days after the index treatment. Redo treatment consisted of 2 DCBs sequentially inflated at the same location (double dose therapy). The majority of patients (66, 78%) had Rutherford category 3 ischemia. The mean lesion length was 140 mm; a third (27, 31%) were total occlusions. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months evaluated by an independent core laboratory. Results: Twenty-two patients (7 DCB +15 uncoated) were treated for recurrence with fully overlapping double DCB angioplasty. Six-month LLL was lower after DCB (0.34\u00b11.12 mm) treatment than after angioplasty with an uncoated balloon (1.58\u00b11.10 mm, p<0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 18 (49%) of 37 patients in the uncoated group, 6 (14%) of 43 patients in the single-dose DCB group (p=0.001), and no patients from the recurrent ISR group. At ~2 years after treatment, a remarkable number (14/27, 52%) of TLRs were recorded in the single-dose DCB group. Conclusion: Treatment with DCBs resulted in significantly less 6-month LLL and fewer TLRs up to 24 months than treatment with uncoated balloons. The double dose for treating recurrent ISR did not cause recognizable adverse events or require TLR up to 24 months.",

    "Title": "Paclitaxel-coated versus plain old balloon angioplasty for the treatment of infrainguinal arterial disease in diabetic patients: the Belgian diabetic IN.PACT Trial.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several trials have shown that drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty reduce the rates of restenosis in the femoropopliteal artery. This controlled, prospective, multicenter study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of DCB to inhibit restenosis of the infrainguinal arteries in an exclusive diabetic population. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, 106 diabetic patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were enrolled at 11 sites in Belgium, 54 treated with DCB angioplasty and 52 treated with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). The primary endpoint of the study are the primary patency, mean diameter restenosis and binary restenosis of the treated sites at 6 months without re-intervention in the interim. RESULTS: The 6-month mean diameter restenosis was significantly lower in the DCB arm than in the POBA group (29\u00b136% vs. 46\u00b135%, P=0.032) and the binary (\u226550% diameter stenosis) restenosis rate was signicantly lower in DCB patients compared with the POBA's (27% vs. 49%, P=0.03). The primary patency was significantly better in the paclitaxel coated balloon group (73% vs. 51%, P=0.03). The 6-month adverse effects rates were 5.5% in the POBA and 5.7% in the DCB arm. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of diabetic PAD of the infra-inguinal arteries with the DCB provides a bettter primary patency rate compared with the plain old balloon angioplasty.

BACKGROUND: Several trials have demonstrated that paclitaxel-eluting balloon angioplasty reduces late luminal loss in comparison with PTA. METHOD: In a prospective, randomized, single-blind, dual-center study, 74 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to in-stent restenosis were treated with either paclitaxel-based drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty (n\u00a0=\u00a035) or standard PTA (n\u00a0= 39). Clinical outcomes and patency rates were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: The mean lesion length was 17.3 \u00b1 11.3 cm in the DEB group and 18.4 \u00b1 8.8 cm in the PTA group. A single major complication (bleeding) was observed once (1.4%). The mean ankle-brachial index before endovascular treatment was 0.65 \u00b1 0.16 in both groups and 0.79 \u00b1 0.2 versus 0.84 \u00b1 0.3 (p\u00a0= 0.70, Student t test) in the DEB versus PTA group at 12 months. The 12-month primary patency rates were 40.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 0.64) versus 13.4% (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.36) (log-rank p\u00a0= 0.02) in the DEB versus PTA group. The odds ratio for PTA over DEB angioplasty for experiencing an event was estimated at 2.8 (95% CI: 1.2 to 6.6). Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 49.0% (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.75) versus 22.1% (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.48) (log-rank p\u00a0= 0.11) in the DEB versus PTA group.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty versus standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). BACKGROUND: Recent trials have reported lower rates of target lesion revascularization with DCB angioplasty versus standard PTA. However, the cost-effectiveness of DCB angioplasty is unknown. METHODS: A prospective economic study was performed alongside the IN.PACT SFA II (IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) trial, which randomized 181 patients with femoropopliteal disease to the IN.PACT DCB versus standard PTA. Resource use data were collected over 2-year follow-up, and costs were assigned using resource-based accounting and billing data. Health utilities were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensions questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a decision-analytic model on the basis of empirical data from the trial assuming identical long-term mortality. RESULTS: Initial costs were $1,129 per patient higher with DCB angioplasty than standard PTA, driven by higher costs for the DCB itself. Between discharge and 24 months, target limb-related costs were $1,212 per patient lower with DCB angioplasty such that discounted 2-year costs were similar for the 2 groups ($11,277 vs. $11,359, p\u00a0= 0.97), whereas QALYs tended to be greater among patients treated with DCBs (1.53 \u00b1 0.44 vs. 1.47 \u00b1 0.42, p\u00a0= 0.40). The probability that DCB angioplasty is cost-effective compared with standard PTA was 70% using a threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained and 79% at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with femoropopliteal disease, DCB angioplasty is associated with better 2-year outcomes and similar target limb-related costs compared with standard PTA. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of these results suggests that use of the DCB angioplasty is likely to be economically attractive.",

METHODS: Among the 476 patients in LEVANT 2, 126 patients (mean age 67.1\u00b19.6 years; 79 men) were enrolled at the 8 participating German sites between August 2011 and July 2012 and were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the Lutonix DCB (n=83) vs an uncoated balloon during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=43). All patients had intermittent claudication or rest pain (Rutherford categories 2-4). Average lesion length was 58 mm and average treated length was 100 mm. Severe calcification was present in 11% of lesions, and 23% were total occlusions. The efficacy outcome was primary patency at 12 months, and the safety outcome was 12-month freedom from a composite of perioperative death, index limb-related death, amputation (below or above the ankle), and index limb revascularization. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse events, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched between Lutonix DCB and PTA groups, as were the final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedure success (91%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 12-month primary patency rate was 80% vs 58% (p=0.015) and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs 72% (p=0.001), respectively. Freedom from TLR was higher for DCBs (96%) vs PTA (82%, p=0.012). Major adverse events were similar for both groups. The benefit favoring DCB over PTA was observed in German men and women. Compared to the non-German LEVANT 2 cohort, there was a shorter time between insertion and inflation of treatment balloons (21.8 vs 39.5 seconds, p<0.001) in the German cohort. Balloons were inflated to higher pressures (9.0 vs 7.7 atm, p<0.001) but for a shorter period of time (130 vs 167 seconds, p<0.001), and although treated lesions in the German cohort had a higher baseline stenosis, final postprocedure diameter stenosis was lower (19% vs 22%, p=0.04) than in the non-German patients. CONCLUSION: Superiority of DCB over PTA in the German cohort of LEVANT 2 was demonstrated for primary patency, composite safety, and freedom from TLR. The benefit of DCB was also consistent for both genders. Geographic or regional differences in procedural variables may account for the different outcomes between the German and non-German cohorts.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of using paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) on outcome after post-angioplasty dissection in femoropopliteal arteries. METHODS: The angiograms obtained in the THUNDER study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00156624) were analyzed to compare degrees of dissection and angiographic parameters between the control (uncoated balloons, n=43) and treatment (PCBs, n=43) groups before and after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, target lesion revascularizations (TLR) were documented up to 2 years. RESULTS: In each group, 24 (56%) patients had a dissection after the intervention. At the 6-month follow-up, patients with dissection of any grade after treatment with PCBs had significantly less late lumen loss (0.4 mm) than patients with dissection after treatment with uncoated balloons (1.9 mm, p=0.001) and a lower degree of stenosis (20% vs. 51%, respectively; p=0.003). Patients with severe dissection (grades C, D, or E) especially seemed to benefit from the PCBs, with late lumen loss of 0.4 mm vs. 2.4 mm for controls (p=0.05). The binary restenosis rate was also markedly lower in the PCB group (20%) than in the uncoated group (55%, p=0.02). In the 2-year follow-up, TLR was performed in 56% of patients in the control group compared to 10% of patients in the PCB group (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: The results of this subgroup analysis suggest that patients with dissection following treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon have a very acceptable outcome and stent implantation is not necessary as long as the dissection does not result in acute flow limitation.",

    "Title": "Overview of the 2014 Food and Drug Administration Circulatory System Devices Panel meeting regarding the Lutonix\u00ae drug coated balloon.",
    "Abstract": "The Lutonix\u00ae drug coated balloon (DCB) is a combination device composed of a standard percutaneous angioplasty balloon coated with paclitaxel. Depending on the balloon size, a dose density of 2\u03bcg/mm(2) yields a variable total dose raging from 1.5mg to 3.8mg. This drug coated balloon aims to provide improved patency rates in patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal de novo or restenotic atherosclerotic disease. On June 12, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Circulatory System Devices Panel reviewed the Lutonix DCB premarket approval application (PMA). This PMA application was primarily based on data from the pivotal randomized, controlled and multicenter clinical trial, which compared the Lutonix DCB with PTA. This summary aims to describe the discussions and recommendations made by the advisory panel during the meeting. Based on the Panel's recommendations, it is possible that the FDA will approve this device.",

    "Title": "TCTAP A-042 Microcrystalline Paclitaxel Coated Balloon for Revascularization of Femoro-popliteal Artery Disease: Three-year Outcomes of the Randomized BIOPAC Trial",
    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel, microcrystalline, biocompatible polymer paclitaxel-coated balloon (mcPCB) including mortality, restenosis and repeated revascularization rates in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions at long-term follow-up Methods: In this first-in-man, prospective, controlled, randomized trial, 66 patients with femoropopliteal, symptomatic (Rutherford 2B-5) occlusive arterial disease were randomized to either mcPCB (Study Group) or POBA (Control Group) on a 1:1 basis. Late lumen loss (LLL) at six months was the primary endpoint of the study, whereas Serious Adverse Events (SAE: death, amputation, repeated revascularization) were considered a composite secondary endpoint. Routine angiography was scheduled for all study subjects at 6-month follow-up; outpatient appointments were scheduled at 12 and 36 months after intervention. Results: At 6 months, the LLL was by 62% lower in the mcPCB compared to POBA group (0.52\u00b11.3 vs. 1.39\u00b11.1mm; psup<0,01). Binary restenosis occurred in 23% vs 52% patients (p=0.02). At three years, the prevalence of SAE was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (33.3 vs. 63.3%; p=0.02), which mainly resulted from a 2-fold reduction in target vessel revascularization rate (28.6 vs. 59.3%; p=0.02). There was no difference in mortality (7.4 vs 14.3%; p=0.42). Patients with mcPCB were less symptomatic and less likely to adhere to secondary prevention measures. Conclusion: In this pivotal trial, a novel mcPCB was superior to POBA concerning LLL at six-month follow-up, and SAE at twelve months. This result was sustained up to 3 years. There was no difference between groups regarding mortality.",

    "Title": "Randomized, Multicenter Trial of ZENFlow Drug-Eluting Balloon in the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Artery Occlusive Disease",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel paclitaxel-coated balloon catheter in the treatment of chronic atherosclerotic occlusive disease in femoropopliteal arteries. Methods: Patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were prospectively randomized to novel carrier-free ZENFlow (Zhejiang Zylox Medical Device Co Ltd, Hangzhou, China) paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (DCB) group or plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) group. The primary end point was late lumen loss at 6 months assessed by blinded angiographic core laboratory quantitative analyses. Secondary end points included primary target vessel patency at 12 months, binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization, target vessel revascularization, Rutherford class change, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) at 6 months. Results: There were 192 Chinese patients who were randomized in 15 hospitals (93 to DCB and 99 to PBA). The mean age of patients was 68 years; 71.9% were male, and 50.5% were smokers. No significant differences were identified between the groups in terms of baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, Rutherford class, and ABI. Mean lesion length was 62.5 mm; 12.7% had in-stent restenosis, and 37% of lesions were total occlusion. In total, 23 (12%) patients underwent bailout stenting because of flow-limiting dissection after balloon angioplasty. After 6 months, late lumen loss in the DCB and PBA groups was 0.80 \u00b1 0.71 mm and 1.69 \u00b1 0.87 mm (P <.0001), respectively. Primary target vessel patency rate was significantly higher in the DCB group than in the PBA group (54% vs 31.3%; P =.0091) at 12 months. Target vessel restenosis rate was dramatically lower in the DCB group than in the PBA group (16.3% vs 54.6%; P <.0001), as were target lesion revascularization (8.8% vs 27.1%; P =.052) and target vessel revascularization (11.8% vs 30%; P =.0086) at 6 months. Significant improvement in Rutherford class was found in the DCB group compared with the PBA group (P =.0385). Postoperative ABI was markedly increased in the DCB group than in the PBA group (0.89 \u00b1 0.27 vs 0.78 \u00b1 0.28; P =.0182) after 6 months. There were no definitely device-related deaths or major adverse events in either group. Conclusions: Balloon angioplasty using the ZENFlow DCB catheter is a safe and effective method for the treatment of chronic occlusive lesions in the femoropopliteal artery and can achieve satisfactory early and midterm outcomes compared with regular balloon angioplasty.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Second-generation paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) coatings have shown improved outcomes in the experimental setting. However, clinical data are missing. Methods: In this first-in-man prospective, controlled, and randomized trial, patients with femoropopliteal symptomatic (Rutherford 2B-4) occlusive arterial disease were randomized 1:1 to either plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) or PBA followed by microcrystalline PCB (mcPCB; Balton Sp. z o.o., Warsaw, Poland) inflation. Late lumen loss was the primary end point of the study. Serious adverse events (SAEs) including death, amputation, and repeated revascularization were considered secondary end points. Routine angiography was scheduled at 6 months and ambulatory follow-up at 12 in all patients. Current follow-up time and ambulatory control is 3 years. Results: In total, 66 patients were included: 33 randomized to mcPCB and 33 to PBA. Mean lesion length was 58 \u00b1 49 mm vs 63 \u00b1 45 mm, most classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) B (50.0% vs 54.3%) and C category (29.4% vs 20.0%). At 6 months, the late lumen loss was lower by 62% (0.52 \u00b1 1.3 mm vs 1.39 \u00b1 1.1 mm) in the mcPCB group compared with PBA (Psup <.01). Binary restenosis occurred in 23% vs 52% patients subsequently (P =.02). The ankle-brachial index was significantly higher in patients in the studied group (0.97 \u00b1 0.3 vs 0.83 \u00b1 0.1; P =.01). At 1 year, the incidence of SAEs was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (25.0% vs 58.0%; P <.01) driven by twofold reduction of target vessel revascularization (25.0% vs 52.2%; P =.02) in the mcPCB group. In 3 years of follow-up, the mortality rate and incidence of SAEs were higher in the PBA group (P <.05). Conclusions: In this pivotal trial, mcPCB was superior to PBA in terms of restenosis inhibition and reduction of recurrent revascularizations in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease. Results analyzed for mortality rate did not confirm information from publications that suggested higher mortality rate in the drug-coated balloon group. The trial was registered on : NCT02145065.",
