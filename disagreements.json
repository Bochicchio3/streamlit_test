    "LLM_Reasoning": "The abstract provided is labeled as \"nan,\" which typically indicates a missing or undefined value. Without any textual content, it is impossible to determine whether the study meets the inclusion criteria (e.g., study design, intervention comparison, or population focus). The absence of key details precludes proper evaluation against both inclusion and exclusion criteria."
