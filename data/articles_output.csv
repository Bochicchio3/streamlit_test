BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of calcified peripheral artery lesions is associated with suboptimal vessel expansion and increased complication risk. Although initial results from single-arm studies with IVL have been reported, comparative evidence from randomized trials is lacking for most devices in the presence of heavy calcification. METHODS: The Disrupt PAD III (Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System Study for PAD) randomized trial enrolled patients with moderate or severe calcification in a femoropopliteal artery who underwent vessel preparation with IVL or PTA prior to DCB or stenting. The primary endpoint was core lab-adjudicated procedural success (residual stenosis ≤30% without flow-limiting dissection) prior to DCB or stenting. RESULTS: In patients receiving IVL (n = 153) or PTA (n = 153), procedural success was greater in the IVL group (65.8% vs. 50.4%; p = 0.01) and the percentage of lesions with residual stenosis ≤30% (66.4% vs. 51.9%; p = 0.02) was greater in the IVL group, while flow-limiting dissections occurred more frequently in the PTA group (1.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.03). Post-dilatation (5.2% vs. 17.0%; p = 0.001) and stent placement (4.6% vs. 18.3%; p < 0.001) were also greater in the PTA group. The rates of major adverse events (IVL: 0% vs. PTA: 1.3%; p = 0.16) and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (IVL: 0.7% vs. PTA: 0.7%; p = 1.0) at 30 days were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: IVL is an effective vessel preparation strategy that facilitates definitive endovascular treatment in calcified femoropopliteal arteries in patients with peripheral artery disease.

We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

However, uncertainty remains whether the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can improve the outcomes of DCBs. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomized trial, conducted at seven centres in South Korea, compared the outcomes of IVUS-guided vs. angiography-guided angioplasty for treating FPA disease with DCBs. Patients were assigned to receive IVUS-guided (n = 119) or angiography-guided (n = 118) angioplasty using DCBs. The primary endpoint was 12-month primary patency. RESULTS: Between May 2016 and August 2022, 237 patients were enrolled and 204 (86.0%) completed the trial (median follow-up; 363 days). The IVUS guidance group showed significantly higher primary patency [83.8% vs. 70.1%; cumulative difference 19.6% (95% confidence interval 6.8 to 32.3); P = .01] and increased freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization [92.4% vs. 83.0%; difference 11.6% (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 20.1); P = .02], sustained clinical improvement (89.1% vs. 76.3%, P = .01), and haemodynamic improvement (82.4% vs. 66.9%, P = .01) at 12 months compared with the angiography guidance group. The IVUS group utilized larger balloon diameters and pressures for pre-dilation, more frequent post-dilation, and higher pressures for post-dilation, resulting in a greater post-procedural minimum lumen diameter (3.90 ± 0.59 vs. 3.71 ± 0.73 mm, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular ultrasound guidance significantly improved the outcomes of DCBs for FPA disease in terms of primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement at 12 months.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors aimed to compare a stent-avoiding (SA) vs a stent-preferred (SP) strategy, promoting optimal lesion preparation and the use of drug-eluting technologies in both arms. METHODS: Within a prospective, multicenter, pilot study, 120 patients with symptomatic complex femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford classification 2-4, mean lesion length 187.7 ± 78.3 mm, 79.2% total occlusions) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to endovascular treatment with either paclitaxel-coated balloons or polymer-coated, paclitaxel-eluting stents. Lesion preparation including the use of devices for plaque modification and/or removal was at the operators' discretion in both treatment arms. RESULTS: In the SA group, lesion preparation was more frequently performed (71.7% SA [43/60] vs 51.7% [31/60] SP; P = 0.038) with a high provisional stenting rate (48.3% [29/60]). At the 12-month follow-up, primary patency was 78.2% (43/55) in the SA group and 78.6% (44/56) in the SP group (P = 1.0; relative risk: 0.995; 95% CI: 0.818-1.210).

Impaired renal function and subsequent cardiopulmonary dysfunction could also occur. Patients of non-atherosclerotic RAS has a relatively young age and long life expectancy. Revascularization with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a viable treatment option. However, restenosis is unavoidable which limits its use. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) has been proven to be effective in restenosis prevention in femoropopliteal arterial diseases and in patients with renal artery stenosis. And PTA for Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia is safe and clinically successful. Therefore, we could speculate that DCB might have potential efficacy in non-atherosclerotic RAS treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a randomized multi-center-controlled trial. Eighty-four eligible participants will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (plain old balloon, POB) and the experimental group (DCB). Subjects in the former group will receive balloon dilatation alone, and in the latter group will undergo the DCB angioplasty.

The most common manifestation of lower extremity PAD is claudication-a condition which significantly reduces quality of life and functional status. Paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents (PCBs and PESs) represented a breakthrough in the ability to treat medication-refractory patients relative to bare metal stents (BMSs) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) because they improve primary patency rates, reduce target lesion revascularization (TLR), and minimize late-lumen loss for femoropopliteal lesions. As a result, paclitaxel-coated devices (PCDs) were swiftly established as the standard of care for revascularization of femoropopliteal artery disease. A recent meta-analysis of summary-level data demonstrated a late mortality signal for patients treated with paclitaxel-coated devices relative to uncoated devices. This has had a major impact on the vascular community and for the treatment of patients with PAD. Herein, we provide a detailed review of the available data on the late mortality signal associated with paclitaxel. RECENT FINDINGS: In December of 2018, Katsanos et al. J Am Heart Assoc 7: e011245, 2018) published data from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated an increase in mortality at 2 and 5 years in patients treated with PCDs involving the femoropopliteal arterial segment relative to patients treated with uncoated devices. As a result of this analysis, randomized trials were stopped and the FDA sent a letter to healthcare providers recommending restriction of use of these devices to patients at the highest risk of restenosis. As additional data emerged supporting the safety of these devices, the FDA organized an advisory committee meeting to review the available data and to determine a pathway forward. The FDA concluded that there were insufficient data to make a final decision regarding the safety of PCDs. They allowed these devices to remain on the market, but with revised safety labeling and updated their letter to healthcare providers to continue to restrict use to patients at highest risk of reintervention. The FDA also called for additional long-term data, including from RCTs and real-world data. To date, an updated patient-level meta-analysis of clinical trial data, RCTs with longer-term follow-up, and large observational studies have been conducted. While meta-analyses conducted using overlapping clinical trial data have found a persistent increase in mortality for those treated with PCDs, individual industry-sponsored RCTs and large observational studies have consistently failed to detect a corresponding mortality increase. To date, no mechanism linking paclitaxel to mortality has been observed. We are currently at an impasse for drawing definitive conclusions regarding the long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated devices. As we await enrollment in ongoing clinical trials, we must proceed with making reasonable decisions for our patients' care from the available data, as these devices have important clinical implications for our patients. A critical lesson that can be learned from this controversy is that, for future device trials, committing to long-term follow-up is crucial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""review""]}",10.1007/s11886-021-01477-4,"*Angioplasty, Balloon;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Femoral Artery;Humans;Paclitaxel;*Peripheral Arterial Disease/therapy;Popliteal Artery;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Patency",33738616.0,PMC8075633,Excluded,"The abstract is a review article and not an RCT; it compares PCDs (including stents) vs uncoated devices, not strictly DCB vs POBA.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

The one-year primary endpoint of JET-RANGER has been recently published. The 2-year outcome data are presented in this report. METHODS: There were 43 patients who completed the 1-year follow-up. Two were lost to follow-up and one died prior to the 2-year follow-up, resulting in 40 patients. Fifteen patients were randomized to PTA+PCB and 25 patients to JET +PCB. Kaplan Meier Survival analysis was performed to estimate the freedom from TLR. Bailout stenting was not considered a TLR in this analysis. Statistical significance was determined by a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Freedom from TLR was similar between the 2 groups at 2 years. There was also no significant difference in the change of ABI between the PTA + PCB and JET + PCB from baseline at 6-months, (p-value = 0.7890), 1-year (p-value = 0.4070), and 2-year (p-value=0.7410). There was also no statistical difference between the JET + PCB and PTA + PCB arms for RCC improvement by one or more category, (p-value= 1.000). There were no minor or major amputations for either arm throughout the 2-year follow up. One JET + PCB patient died before the 2-year specified window.

Limitations of DEB treatment and trials in BTK arteries had been reported, hence a technical evaluation of possible side effects of DCB treatment and of trial design was taken into account. On the basis of the results available, the distinguishing findings of drug eluting effects in the femoropopliteal region cannot be transferred to BTK arteries. Refinement of the existing DCB technology and of future trial design should be considered. To adjudicate on DCB technology applied for BTK treatment is premature and it is mandatory to be kept under evaluation, because the potential benefit, with respect to the compelling results in the femoropoliteal arteries, could be huge to improve endovascular BTK and especially CLI treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population,wrong publication type | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""review""]}",,"Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Constriction, Pathologic;Humans;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*therapy;Prosthesis Design;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recurrence;Risk Factors;*Tibial Arteries/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",27465390.0,,Excluded,"The study is a review of RCTs, not an RCT itself, and focuses on BTK lesions which are excluded.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the safety and efficacy of the Passeo-18 Lux drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Biotronik AG) for the treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease caused by stenosis, restenosis, or occlusion of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries. METHODS: A total of 302 patients were randomized 1:1 and assigned to the Passeo-18 Lux DCB (study device) group or the IN.PACT Admiral DCB (control device, Medtronic Vascular) group for testing of noninferiority. The primary efficacy endpoint was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of freedom from device-/procedure-related death through 30 days postindex procedure, major target limb amputation, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, 130 of 134 patients in the IN.PACT Admiral group had freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (97.0%) compared with 137 of 141 patients in the Passeo-18 Lux group (97.2%).

However, patency loss occurs in ≥10% of patients within 12 months posttreatment with poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to investigate the determinants of DCB failure in femoropopliteal disease. METHODS: Data from randomized clinical trials (IN.PACT SFA, MDT-2113 SFA Japan) and 2 prespecified imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Clinical Study were included. Influential procedural characteristics were evaluated by an independent angiographic core laboratory. The primary endpoint was DCB failure (patency loss during follow-up). Additional endpoints were binary restenosis and clinically driven target lesion revascularization. Multivariable analyses evaluated the clinical, anatomical, and procedural predictors of DCB failure. RESULTS: Included were 557 participants with single lesions and 12-month core laboratory-adjudicated duplex ultrasonography. Key clinical characteristics were as follows: mean age 68.8 years, 67.5% male, 87.6% with hypertension, 76.9% with hyperlipidemia, 40.5% with diabetes mellitus, 90.5% in Rutherford Classification Category (RCC) 2 to 3, and 9.5% in RCC 4 to 5. Average length and reference vessel diameter (RVD) were 16.37 cm and 4.66 mm, respectively; 49.7% of lesions were totally occluded. In multivariable analysis, only residual stenosis >30% was associated with patency loss, whereas residual stenosis >30% and smaller preprocedure RVD were associated with increased binary restenosis risk. RCC >3 and residual stenosis >30% were associated with increased 12-month clinically driven target lesion revascularization risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patency loss after DCB treatment was influenced by procedural and clinical factors. Residual stenosis >30%, smaller preprocedure RVD, and higher RCC may be considered predictors of increased risk of DCB failure and its components in femoropopliteal artery disease.

The main issue of these techniques is restenosis which is a complex mechanism associating elastic recoil, constrictive remodelling and intimal hyperplasia. More and more evidence show that drug-coating balloon (DCB) is a promising device to prevent and to treat restenosis. Herein we have reviewed the role for DCB's in the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Currently, few studies are available regarding DCB use for femoropopliteal (FP) ISR treatment. In different studies evaluating DCB for treatment of FP ISR the freedom from target lesion revascularization rate at one year are range from 87% to 92.1%. In comparison to other devices used for treatment of FP ISR such as atherectomy, cutting balloon, standard angioplasty, DCB seems to show better results in terms of freedom from TLR and primary patency. Other devices such as drug-eluting stent, brachytherapy, covered stent show also good results for FP ISR. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Majority of assessed data on FP ISR treated with DCB derived from uncontrolled study or historical comparisons. Only one randomized, controlled study compared DCB versus standard angioplasty. The FAIR trial showed better results in favour of DCB in terms of freedom from TLR at 12 months (90.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Drug coating balloon could be the first choice of devices for the treatment of FP ISR, because of its efficacy, its ease of use in comparison with more complex and less efficient devices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""review""]}",,"Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Constriction, Pathologic;Endovascular Procedures/*adverse effects/*instrumentation;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Humans;Hyperplasia;Neointima;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Recurrence;Retreatment;Risk Factors;*Stents;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices",27102629.0,,Excluded,"The abstract describes a review article discussing existing studies, including one RCT (FAIR trial), but is not itself an RCT comparing DCB vs POBA.

Treatment modalities have included risk factor optimization through life-style modifications and medications, or operative approaches using both open and minimally invasive techniques, such as balloon angioplasty. Drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty has emerged as a promising alternative to uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of this difficult disease process. By ballooning and coating the inside of atherosclerotic vessels with cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, cellular mechanisms responsible for atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia are inhibited and its devastating complications are prevented or postponed. DEBs are considerably more expensive than uncoated balloons, and their efficacy in improving patient outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) compared with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty in people with symptomatic lower-limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched December 2015) and Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (2015, Issue 11). The TSC searched trial databases for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials that compared DEBs with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty for intermittent claudication (IC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (AK, TA) independently selected the appropriate trials and performed data extraction, assessment of trial quality, and data analysis. The senior review author (DKR) adjudicated any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials that randomized 1838 participants met the study inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials included femoropopliteal arterial lesions, three included tibial arterial lesions, and one included both. The trials were carried out in Europe and in the USA and all used the taxane drug paclitaxel in the DEB arm. Nine of the 11 trials were industry-sponsored. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices (Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic). The trials examined both anatomic and clinical endpoints. There was heterogeneity in the frequency of stent deployment and the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy between trials. Using GRADE assessment criteria, the quality of the evidence presented was moderate for the outcomes of target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category, and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle-brachial index (ABI). Most participants were followed up for 12 months, but one trial reported outcomes at five years.There were better outcomes for DEBs for up to two years in primary vessel patency (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 9.57 at six months; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56 at 12 months; OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.26 to 5.46 at two years) and at six months and two years for late lumen loss (mean difference (MD) -0.64 mm, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.28 at six months; MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.16 at two years). DEB were also superior to uncoated balloon angioplasty for up to five years in target lesion revascularization (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47 at six months; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.51 at 12 months; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44 at two years; OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.51 at five years) and binary restenosis rate (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67 at six months; OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98 at 12 months; OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66 at two years; OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.30 at five years). There was no significant difference between DEB and uncoated angioplasty in amputation, death, change in ABI, change in Rutherford category and quality of life (QoL) scores, or functional walking ability, although none of the trials were powered to detect a significant difference in these clinical endpoints. We carried out two subgroup analyses to examine outcomes in femoropopliteal and tibial interventions as well as in people with CLI (4 or greater Rutherford class), and showed no advantage for DEBs in tibial vessels at six and 12 months compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. There was also no advantage for DEBs in CLI compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty at 12 months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis of 11 trials with 1838 participants, there is evidence of an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty in several anatomic endpoints such as primary vessel patency (high-quality evidence), binary restenosis rate (moderate-quality evidence), and target lesion revascularization (low-quality evidence) for up to 12 months. Conversely, there is no evidence of an advantage for DEBs in clinical endpoints such as amputation, death, or change in ABI, or change in Rutherford category during 12 months' follow-up. Well-designed randomized trials with long-term follow-up are needed to compare DEBs with uncoated balloon angioplasties adequately for both anatomic and clinical study endpoints before the widespread use of this expensive technology can be justified.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""SISTEMATIC REVIEW""]}",10.1002/14651858.CD011319.pub2,"Amputation, Surgical/statistics & numerical data;Angioplasty, Balloon/*methods/mortality;Drug-Eluting Stents;Femoral Artery;Humans;Lower Extremity/*blood supply;Paclitaxel/*therapeutic use;Peripheral Arterial Disease/mortality/*therapy;Popliteal Artery;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Tibial Arteries;Time Factors;Vascular Patency",27490003.0,PMC8504434,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Excluded,Disagree

Prespecified subjects were selected for core-laboratory-adjudicated duplex ultrasound imaging, including a subcohort with long lesions (≥15 cm). Methods and Results Subjects were followed for 12 months. The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related mortality through 30 days and freedom from major target limb amputation and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization through 12 months. An independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all adverse events. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency at 12 months (by duplex ultrasound). The long lesion imaging cohort had 157 subjects (164 lesions). Mean lesion length was 26.40±8.61 cm. Provisional stents were implanted in 39.4% (63/160) of lesions. Primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate was 91.1%, and freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization was 94.2% at 12 months. The primary safety composite end point was achieved by 94.0% (126/134) of subjects. There were no device- or procedure-related deaths or major target limb amputations.

However, limited data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of DCB vs bare-metal stents (BMS). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare DCB vs BMS outcomes in a propensity-adjusted, pooled analysis of 4 prospective, multicenter trials. METHODS: Patient-level data were pooled from 4 prospective, multicenter studies: the IN.PACT SFA I/II and IN.PACT SFA Japan randomized controlled DCB trials and the Complete SE and DURABILITY II single-arm BMS studies. Outcomes were compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Clinical endpoints were 12-month primary patency, freedom from 36-month clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and cumulative 36-month major adverse events (MAE). RESULTS: The primary analysis included 771 patients (288 DCB, 483 BMS). IPTW-adjusted demographic, baseline lesion, and procedural characteristics were matched between groups. The adjusted mean lesion length was 8.1 ± 4.7 cm DCB and 7.9 ± 4.5 cm BMS. The IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates of 12-month primary patency (90.4% DCB, 80.9% BMS, P = 0.007), freedom from 36-month clinically driven target lesion revascularization (85.6% DCB, 73.7% BMS, P = 0.001), and cumulative incidence of 36-month MAE (25.3% DCB, 38.8% BMS, P < 0.001) favored DCB. There were no statistically significant differences observed in all-cause mortality, target limb major amputation, or thrombosis through 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a patient-level, IPTW-adjusted pooled analysis of prospective, multicenter pivotal studies, DCB demonstrated significantly higher patency, lower revascularization and MAE rates, and no statistically significant differences in mortality, amputation, or thrombosis vs BMS.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the 24-month results on the efficacy and safety of low-dose vs high-dose PCBs with nominal paclitaxel densities of 2.0 and 3.5 μg/mm(2) and different coating technologies for femoropopliteal interventions from the COMPARE (Compare I Pilot Study for the Treatment of Subjects With Symptomatic Femoropopliteal Artery Disease) trial. Procedural characteristics of clinically driven (CD) target lesion revascularization (TLR) were analyzed. METHODS: Within a prospective, multicenter, clinical trial, 414 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford categories 2-4, maximum lesion length 30 cm) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular treatment with either a low-dose (Ranger) or a high-dose (IN.PACT) PCB after stratification for lesion length. Two-year follow-up included assessment of primary patency (defined as absence of CD TLR or binary restenosis with a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4 by duplex ultrasound), safety, and functional and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: At 2 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency were 70.6% and 71.4% for the low-dose and high-dose PCBs (log-rank P = 0.96), respectively. One major amputation occurred in the high-dose group, and rates of all-cause mortality (3.6% vs 2.2%; P = 0.55) and CD TLR (17.3% vs 13.0%; P = 0.31) were similar between the groups. Among a total of 57 CD TLRs, 44.6% were performed for reocclusion and 28.1% for in-stent restenosis. Functional and clinical benefits over baseline were sustained in both groups.

However, a recent meta-analysis of trial data suggested an increased risk of mortality with PCD usage. Although subsequent studies have found no association with mortality, the subject has remained controversial. Thus, the aim of the present study was to further investigate the outcomes and causes of mortality for patients treated with PCDs. METHODS: Patients who had undergone endovascular interventions for PAD from 2013 to 2016 at a single institution were reviewed. The patients were stratified by the use of PCDs, which included drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents. The cumulative dose of paclitaxel was calculated for the patients who had received multiple interventions. The causes of mortality were identified and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of the 366 included patients, 138 (38%) had received a PCD and 228 (62%) had received a non-drug-coated (NDC) device. Patients treated with PCDs were less likely to have undergone open surgery compared with patients treated with NDC devices. No differences were found in the indications or 30-day outcomes between the two groups. After a mean follow-up of 3.1 ± 1.8 years, no differences were found in the primary patency, reintervention rate, mean number of reinterventions, major amputation (5% vs 4%; P = .465), or mortality (16% vs 20%; P = .363) between the PCD and NDC groups. Also, no overall difference was found in the cause of mortality with and without PCD use or in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Furthermore, PCD use was not associated with an increased risk of mortality in Cox regression analysis. The cumulative dose of paclitaxel in patients treated with PCDs ranged from 383 to 49,259 μg (median, 7561 μg). A comparison of the patients treated with a cumulative dose of paclitaxel in the upper 50th percentile compared with the lower 50th percentile showed no significant differences in mortality (13% vs 19%; P = .333). CONCLUSIONS: PCD use was shown to be safe and not associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality in the present study. Continued monitoring of PCD use is warranted to ensure the safety of this technology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""paclitaxel balloon and/or paclitaxel stent vs non drug coated devices""]}",10.1016/j.jvs.2020.08.146,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Amputation, Surgical;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;*Drug-Eluting Stents;Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/*instrumentation/mortality;Female;Humans;Limb Salvage;Male;Middle Aged;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy;Prosthesis Design;Retreatment;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Patency",33038480.0,,Excluded,Non-randomized study comparing a combined PCD group (DCB + stents) rather than strictly DCB vs POBA.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

When a stent develops a flow-limiting stenosis, this process is known as ""in-stent stenosis."" It is thought that in-stent restenosis is caused by a process known as ""intimal hyperplasia"" rather than by the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Management of in-stent restenosis may include performing balloon angioplasty, deploying another stent within the stenosed stent to force it open, and creating a bypass to deliver blood around the stent. The role of drug-eluting technologies, such as drug-eluting balloons (DEBs), in the management of in-stent restenosis is unclear. Drug-eluting balloons might function by coating the inside of stenosed stents with cytotoxic chemicals such as paclitaxel and by inhibiting the hyperplastic processes responsible for in-stent restenosis. It is important to perform this systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of DEB because of the potential for increased expenses associated with DEBs over uncoated balloon angioplasty, also known as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty in people with in-stent restenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries as assessed by criteria such as amputation-free survival, vessel patency, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis rate, and death. We define ""in-stent restenosis"" as 50% or greater narrowing of a previously stented vessel by duplex ultrasound or angiography. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to November 28, 2017. Review authors also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials that compared DEBs versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for treatment of in-stent restenosis in the femoropopliteal arteries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (AK, WA) independently selected appropriate trials and performed data extraction, assessment of trial quality, and data analysis. The senior review author (AD) adjudicated any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials that randomized a combined total of 263 participants met the review inclusion criteria. All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries. These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons. Two of the three trials were industry sponsored. Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany; Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA). The trials examined both anatomical and clinical endpoints. We noted heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment between studies as well as in the dosage of paclitaxel applied by the DEBs. Using GRADE assessment criteria, we determined that the certainty of evidence presented was very low for the outcomes of amputation, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis, death, and improvement of one or more Rutherford categories. Most participants were followed up to 12 months, but one trial followed participants for up to 24 months.Trial results show no difference in the incidence of amputation between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. DEBs showed better outcomes for up to 24 months for target lesion revascularization (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.92 at six months; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70 at 24 months) and at six and 12 months for binary restenosis (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56 at six months; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.76 at 12 months). Participants treated with DEBs also showed improvement of one or more Rutherford categories at six and 12 months (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.21 at six months; OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.83 at 12 months). Data show no clear differences in death between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. Data were insufficient for subgroup or sensitivity analyses to be conducted. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis of three trials with 263 participants, evidence suggests an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty for anatomical endpoints such as target lesion revascularization (TLR) and binary restenosis, and for one clinical endpoint - improvement in Rutherford category post intervention for up to 24 months. However, the certainty of evidence for all these outcomes is very low due to the small number of included studies and participants and the high risk of bias in study design. Adequately powered and carefully constructed randomized controlled trials are needed to adequately investigate the role of drug-eluting technologies in the management of in-stent restenosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""Systematic Review""]}",10.1002/14651858.CD012510.pub2,"Amputation, Surgical;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*methods;Ankle Brachial Index;Constriction, Pathologic/etiology/mortality/therapy;*Femoral Artery;Humans;*Popliteal Artery;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recurrence;*Stents;Vascular Patency",30684445.0,PMC6353053,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Excluded,Disagree

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between an LD-DCB (Ranger; 2.0 μg/mm(2)) and an HD-DCB (IN.PACT; 3.5 μg/mm(2)) in patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. METHODS: PROSPECT MONSTER (Prospective Comparison of Second-Generation Low-Dose Drug-Coated Balloon With High-Dose Drug-Coated Balloon) was a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial that prospectively collected data from 581 patients who underwent endovascular therapy with the LD-DCB (n = 370) or the HD-DCB (n = 211) for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease (Rutherford classes 2-5). The primary outcome was the 1-year primary patency of the LD-DCB in comparison with that of the HD-DCB, as evaluated using propensity score matching. The incidence of impaired flow after drug-coated balloon application was also evaluated. RESULTS: Propensity score matching extracted 163 pairs (358 and 163 patients in the LD-DCB and HD-DCB groups, respectively), with no significant intergroup difference in baseline characteristics. The 1-year primary patency rates in the matched population were similar between the LD-DCB and HD-DCB groups (87.0% [95% CI: 82.5%-91.7%] vs 81.3% [95% CI: 74.8%-88.5%]; HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.55-1.59; P = 0.79), as was the incidence of impaired flow (13.6% vs 9.8%; OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.78-2.73; P = 0.24). No baseline characteristics had any significant interaction effects on the association of the LD-DCB vs the HD-DCB and 1-year restenosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: LD-DCBs demonstrate efficacy and safety comparable with HD-DCBs in patients with complex clinical backgrounds, suggesting that drug-coated balloon treatment using a lower dose may be possible.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""Low-Dose vs High-Dose Drug-Coated Balloon, Non randomized""]}",10.1016/j.jcin.2023.08.022,"Humans;*Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects;*Cardiovascular Agents/adverse effects;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging;Paclitaxel;*Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/therapy;Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Patency;Prospective Studies",37804292.0,,Excluded,Nonrandomized study comparing two types of DCBs instead of DCB vs POBA.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

METHODS: We are conducting a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center, noninferiority study. All consecutive patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria are sequentially and consecutively assigned to either paclitaxel (Ranger, Boston Scientific) or sirolimus (MagicTouch, Concept Medical) coated balloon angioplasty treatment. The primary outcome are procedural success and primary vessel patency at index procedure. The secondary outcomes are 30-day and 12-month freedom from MAEs (amputation, death, TLR/TVR, MI, distal embolization that requires a separate intervention or hospitalization), procedural success (≤30% residual diameter stenosis or occlusion after the procedure), Rutherford category improvement (reduction ≤1 category) and ABI improvement (increase ≥0.10 from baseline). RESULTS: A total of six patients have been enrolled in the present study up to now. The mean age was 72.6 years old and five were male. All patients had angiographic evidence of isolated occlusion in the transition segment of the distal femoral superficial artery in the popliteal artery. The mean length was 109 mm.

A recent meta-analysis of heterogeneous trials of paclitaxel-based balloons and stents reported that they are associated with increased mortality and that higher doses are linked to higher mortality from 2 to 5 years. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a correlation between paclitaxel exposure and mortality by conducting an independent patient-level meta-analysis of 1,980 patients with up to 5-year follow-up. METHODS: Data from 2 single-arm and 2 randomized independently adjudicated prospective studies of a paclitaxel DCB (n = 1,837) and uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (n = 143) were included. Analyses of baseline, procedure, and follow-up data of individual patients were performed to explore correlations of paclitaxel dose with long-term mortality. Survival time by paclitaxel dose tercile was analyzed with adjustment of inverse probability weighting to correct baseline imbalances and study as random effect. A standard cohort was defined to compare DCB- and PTA-treated patients with similar characteristics by applying criteria from pivotal studies (n = 712 DCB, n = 143 PTA). RESULTS: A survival analysis stratified nominal paclitaxel dose by low, mid, and upper terciles; mean doses were 5,019.0, 10,007.5, and 19,978.2 μg, respectively. Rates of freedom from all-cause mortality between the 3 groups through 5 years were 85.8%, 84.2%, and 88.2%, respectively (p = 0.731). There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between DCB and PTA through 5 years comparing all patients (unadjusted p = 0.092) or patients with similar characteristics (adjusted p = 0.188). CONCLUSIONS: This independent patient-level meta-analysis demonstrates that this paclitaxel DCB is safe.

BACKGROUND: A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of heterogenous trials and summary-level data identified increased long-term mortality in patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents. METHODS: We evaluated DCB angioplasty (n = 1,093) and uncoated balloon angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n = 250) outcomes in LEVANT 1 (The Lutonix Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon for the Prevention of Femoropopliteal Restenosis), LEVANT 2 (Moxy Drug Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Arteries), and the LEVANT Japan Clinical Trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mortality rates between DCB angioplasty and PTA. The 5-year HR was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68 to 1.52) in the aggregated LEVANT trials. The 2-year HR after DCB angioplasty was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.25 to 3.95) in LEVANT 1, 1.40 (95% CI: 0.62 to 3.14) in LEVANT 2, and 0.32 (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.92) in the LEVANT Japan Clinical Trial. The 5-year HR was 1.60 (95% CI: 0.94 to 2.72) in LEVANT 2. Adverse events and causes of death were balanced, without clustering between DCB angioplasty and PTA. Patients who underwent paclitaxel or nonpaclitaxel reinterventions had higher survival rates than those who did not undergo reinterventions. Baseline covariates predicting mortality included, among others, age (HR: 1.03 per year; p < 0.0001), prior treatment of target lesion (HR: 1.67; p = 0.022), arrhythmia (HR: 1.65; p = 0.031), and diabetes (HR: 1.18; p = 0.047), without differences between the 2 arms. No dose-response relationship was identified when adjusted for key predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of patient-level data identified no mortality differences between DCB angioplasty and PTA. Furthermore, the lack of dose-response relationships or clustering of causes of death argues against a causal relationship between paclitaxel and mortality.

However, there has not been a clinical trial comparing the 2 treatments directly. This study aims to compare the primary patency (PP) and clinical outcomes of SG and DCB for endovascular treatment of complex FP Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C/D lesions in patients. METHODS: From July 2013 to May 2019, a retrospective study was conducted at 2 medical centers to compare the clinical outcomes of Viabahn SG and DCB angioplasty in patients with TASC C/D FP lesions. The study used overlap weighting to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and to reduce the impact of confounding factors and selection bias between the 2 groups. The primary endpoint was PP through 24 months, and the secondary endpoints included freedom from clinical-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), all-cause of death rate, and major amputation rate. RESULTS: A total of 161 limbs in 150 patients with TASC C/D FP lesions were treated either with Viabahn SGs (67 limbs, 65 patients) or DCBs (94 limbs, 85 patients). In the DCB group, 22 target vessels (23.4%) underwent directional atherectomy before DCB angioplasty and 37 target vessels (39.4%) underwent bail-out bare-metal stent implantation for early recoil or severe dissection. The SG group had significantly higher PP rates at both the 12 and 24 months than in the DCB group (75.8% vs 39.2%, p=0.02; 64.1% vs 31.9%, p=0.02), respectively. However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of CD-TLR, death rate, and major amputation rate. According to the results of multivariate analysis, DCB angioplasty was the only independent predictor associated with restenosis (hazard ratio [HR]=0.264, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.100-0.696, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SG was associated with a significantly higher PP rate in complex long FP lesions compared with DCB angioplasty. However, there was no significant difference in the freedom from CD-TLR and major amputation rate. It is important to follow the criteria for using SG strictly to avoid early restenosis, which can lead to acute thrombosis and severe limb ischemia. Closer monitoring is recommended for patients who undergo SG implantation. CLINICAL IMPACT: There has no head-to-head clinical trial that compares DCB and SG in complex long FP lesions. This study showed that SG following the criteria was associated with a significantly higher PP rate compared with DCB angioplasty. Closer monitoring is recommended for patients with SG to avoid acute thrombosis.

To determine the potential long-term impact of DCB treatment with provisional bare metal stenting in complex lesions in real-world patients, a post hoc analysis was performed on data from the IN.PACT Global Study (The IN.PACT Global Clinical Study for the Treatment of Comprehensive Superficial Femoral and/or Popliteal Artery Lesions Using the IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Eluting Balloon). Five-year outcomes were compared between participants who were stented after DCB treatment versus those treated with DCB alone. METHODS: The IN.PACT Global Study enrolled 1535 participants with intermittent claudication and/or ischemic rest pain caused by femoropopliteal lesions; 1397 patients were included in this subgroup analysis (353 stented and 1044 nonstented). Effectiveness was assessed as freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 60 months. The primary safety composite end point was defined as freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from major target limb amputation and clinically driven target vessel revascularization through 60 months. RESULTS: Lesions in the stented group were longer (15.37 versus 10.98 cm; P<0.001) and had more total occlusions (54.7% versus 28.6%; P<0.001) compared with the nonstented group. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimated freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was similar between groups (66.8% stented versus 70.0% nonstented group, log-rank P=0.22). The safety composite end point was achieved in 64.5% stented versus 68.2% nonstented participants (log-rank P=0.19) as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.

Drug-coated angioplasty balloons deliver antiproliferative agents directly to the artery, potentially improving vessel patency by reducing restenosis. METHODS: In this single-blind, randomized trial conducted at 54 sites, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 476 patients with symptomatic intermittent claudication or ischemic pain while at rest and angiographically significant atherosclerotic lesions to angioplasty with a paclitaxel-coated balloon or to standard angioplasty. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency of the target lesion at 12 months (defined as freedom from binary restenosis or from the need for target-lesion revascularization). The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from perioperative death from any cause and freedom at 12 months from limb-related death (i.e., death from a medical complication related to a limb), amputation, and reintervention. RESULTS: The two groups were well matched at baseline; 42.9% of the patients had diabetes, and 34.7% were current smokers. At 12 months, the rate of primary patency among patients who had undergone angioplasty with the drug-coated balloon was superior to that among patients who had undergone conventional angioplasty (65.2% vs. 52.6%, P=0.02). The proportion of patients free from primary safety events was 83.9% with the drug-coated balloon and 79.0% with standard angioplasty (P=0.005 for noninferiority). There were no significant between-group differences in functional outcomes or in the rates of death, amputation, thrombosis, or reintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with a paclitaxel-coated balloon resulted in a rate of primary patency at 12 months that was higher than the rate with angioplasty with a standard balloon. The drug-coated balloon was noninferior to the standard balloon with respect to safety.

The initial enthusiasm correlated to some studies is not confirmed by the largest randomized trial, IN.PACT Deep, comparing In.Pact DCB to standard PTA. This trial failed completely to show the superiority of drug coated balloon (DCB).

The Chocolate Touch DCB is a nitinol constrained balloon designed to reduce acute vessel trauma and inhibit neointima formation and restenosis. METHODS: Patients with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford class 2-4) and superficial femoral or popliteal disease (≥70% stenosis) were randomized 1:1 to Chocolate Touch or Lutonix DCB at 34 sites in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand. The primary efficacy end point was DCB success, defined as primary patency at 12 months (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4 by duplex ultrasound without clinically driven target lesion revascularization in the absence of clinically driven bailout stenting). The primary safety end point was freedom from major adverse events at 12 months, a composite of target limb-related death, major amputation, or reintervention. Both primary end points were tested for noninferiority, and if met, sequential superiority testing for efficacy followed by safety was prespecified. An independent clinical events committee, and angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories blinded to treatment allocation reviewed all end points. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients were randomized to Chocolate Touch (n=152) versus Lutonix DCB (n=161). Follow-up at 1 year was available in 94% of patients. The mean age was 69.4±9.5 years, the average lesion length was 78.1±46.9 mm, and 46.2% had moderate-to-severe calcification. The primary efficacy rates of DCB success at 12 months was 78.8% (108/137) with Chocolate Touch and 67.7% (88/130) with Lutonix DCB (difference, 11.1% [95% CI, 0.6-21.7]), meeting noninferiority (P(noninferiority)<0.0001) and sequential superiority (P(superiority)=0.04). The primary safety event rate was 88.9% (128/144) with Chocolate Touch and 84.6% (126/149) with Lutonix DCB (P(noninferiority)<0.001; P(superiority)=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, the second-generation Chocolate Touch DCB met both noninferiority end points for efficacy and safety and was more effective than Lutonix DCB at 12 months for the treatment of femoropopliteal disease.

To date, head-to-head comparisons are missing. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to compare DES versus DCB for femoropopliteal lesions through 36 months. METHODS: Within a multicenter, randomized trial, 150 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease were randomly assigned to primary DES implantation or DCB angioplasty with bailout stenting after stratification for lesion length (≤10 cm, >10 cm to ≤20 cm, and >20 cm to ≤30 cm). The primary effectiveness endpoint was primary patency at 12 months assessed by Kaplan-Meier. Secondary endpoints comprised major adverse events including death, major amputations, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: More than one-half of lesions were total occlusions, and the stenting rate was 25.3% in the DCB group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency were 79% and 80% for DES and DCB at 12 months (p = 0.96) but decreased to 54% and 38% through 36 months (p = 0.17), respectively. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was >90% at 12 months but dropped to around 70% at 36 months in both groups.

This study reports 3 year and 5 year outcomes of the pre-specified 150 mm balloon sub-cohort of the IN.PACT Global Study. METHODS: The IN.PACT Global Study was a prospective, multicentre, international, single-arm study evaluating the performance of the IN.PACT Admiral DCB in real-world patients with femoropopliteal atherosclerotic disease. This pre-specified 150 mm DCB cohort analysis comprised 107 participants (111 lesions) with all target lesions treated with at least one 150 mm DCB. RESULTS: Mean lesion length was 20.3 ± 9.2 cm; 18.0% had in-stent restenosis, 58.6% were totally occluded, and 17.1% were severely calcified.

This is a pilot first-in-human study of MagicTouch percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) SCB for treatment of PAOD for both femoropopliteal and below the knee arteries (BTK). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Xtreme Touch-Neo [MagicTouch PTA] Sirolimus Coated Balloon (XTOSI) pilot study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-center trial evaluating MagicTouch PTA SCB for symptomatic PAOD. Primary endpoint was defined as primary patency at 6 months (duplex ultrasound peak systolic velocity ratio ≤2.4). Secondary endpoints included clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), amputation free survival (AFS), all-cause mortality, and limb salvage success. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited. The mean age was 67 (n=31 [62%] males). SCB was applied to femoropopliteal in 20 patients (40%) and BTK in 30 patients (60%). Majority of treatments (94%) were performed for limb salvage indications (Rutherford scores 5 or 6). This was a high risk cohort, in which 90% had diabetes, 36% had coronary artery disease, 20% had end stage renal failure, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score was 3 or more in 80%. Mean lesion length treated was 227±81 mm, of which 36% were total occlusions. Technical and device success were both 100%. At 30 days, mortality was 2% and major limb amputation was also 2%. Six-month primary patency was 80% (88.2% for femoropopliteal; 74% for BTK). At 12 months, freedom from CD-TLR was 89.7% (94.1% for femoropopliteal; 86.3% for BTK), AFS was 81.6% (90.0% for femoropopliteal; 75.9% for BTK), all-cause mortality was 14.3% (10.0% for femoropopliteal; 17.2% for BTK), and limb salvage success was 92.9% (94.4% for femoropopliteal; 91.7% for BTK). There was a statistically significant increase between baseline and 6-month toe pressures for both femoropopliteal (57.3±23.3 mm Hg vs 82.5±37.8 mm Hg; p<.001) and BTK lesions (52.8±19.2 mm Hg vs 70.7±37 mm Hg; p<.037). At 12 months, wound healing rate was 33/39 (84.6%). CONCLUSIONS: MagicTouch PTA SCB in the XTOSI study showed promising 6-month primary patency and encouraging 12-month freedom from CD-TLR, AFS, and limb salvage rates. No early safety concerns were raised.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia who required endovascular femoro-popliteal, with or without infra-popliteal, revascularisation. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to femoro-popliteal plain balloon angioplasty with or without bare metal stenting (PBA±BMS), drug coated balloon angioplasty with or without bare metal stenting (DCBA±BMS), or drug eluting stenting (DES) as their first revascularisation strategy.

Drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment has been proven safe and effective in reducing the rate of restenosis for simple and short lesions. However, the clinical results of DCBs for long lesions are still very limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCBs in the treatment of long femoropopliteal artery disease. And the results of this study will also complement the existing evidence of DCB treatment of long lesions. METHODS: Patients with lesion length ≥ 15cm according to computed tomography angiography (CTA) or angiography in the AcoArt I Study were included into this study. Based on the balloon catheter used in treatment, patients were divided into the DCB group and the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) group. The demographic, lesion, and procedural characteristics and 24-month follow-up results were compared between the 2 groups. The primary efficacy endpoints were angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months or at the time of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), primary patency (PP), freedom from CD-TLR, and changes in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford class during 24 months of follow-up. The safety endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse events. RESULTS: The total number of patients was 87, including 42 in the DCB group and 45 in the PTA group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in demographic, lesion,and procedural characteristics. The 6-month follow-up angiography showed that the LLL was significantly smaller in the DCB group than the PTA group (0.27 ± 0.90 mm vs 1.32 ± 0.91 mm; P < 0.001). At 24 months, compared with the PTA group, the DCB group had a significantly higher rate of freedom from CD-TLR (81.58% vs 43.18%; P < 0.001) and a significantly higher PP rate (46.88% vs 15.00%; P = 0.003). The DCB group had a significantly higher ABI than the PTA group at 6, 12, and 24 months (P < 0.001, P = 0.004 and P = 0.018, respectively). The DCB group had a better Rutherford class than the PTA group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.033 and P = 0.012, respectively); the Rutherford class did not significantly differ between the 2 groups at 24 months (P = 0.127). The incidence of major adverse events did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the DCB is superior to a standard uncoated balloon in treating long lesions during 24 months of follow-up.

All-cause mortality at 24 months in diabetics was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6-20.2), and major target limb amputation was 6.1% (95% CI: 4.1-8.9), which was significantly higher than in non-diabetics (8.4% (95% CI: 6.0-11.6), P = 0.0005 and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.9), P <0.0001, respectively). At 24 months, 82.0% of patients had improved by ≥1 Rutherford class. CONCLUSION: Treatment of a real-world diabetic patient population with the Passeo-18 Lux DCB resulted in high efficacy and low complication rates, despite the fact that diabetic patients usually suffer from a multitude of concomitant comorbidities.

Methods and Results A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT s investigating paclitaxel-coated devices in the femoral and/or popliteal arteries was performed. The primary safety measure was all-cause patient death. Risk ratios and risk differences were pooled with a random effects model. In all, 28 RCT s with 4663 patients (89% intermittent claudication) were analyzed. All-cause patient death at 1 year (28 RCT s with 4432 cases) was similar between paclitaxel-coated devices and control arms (2.3% versus 2.3% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72-1.61). All-cause death at 2 years (12 RCT s with 2316 cases) was significantly increased in the case of paclitaxel versus control (7.2% versus 3.8% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15-2.47; -number-needed-to-harm, 29 patients [95% CI , 19-59]). All-cause death up to 5 years (3 RCT s with 863 cases) increased further in the case of paclitaxel (14.7% versus 8.1% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.93; 95% CI , 1.27-2.93; -number-needed-to-harm, 14 patients [95% CI , 9-32]).

DATA SOURCES: The databases PubMed and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were searched on 14 March 2023. REVIEW METHODS: A NMA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of different endovascular revascularisation techniques for treating CLTI was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The primary and secondary outcomes were major amputation and death, respectively. Random effects models were developed and the results were presented using surface under the cumulative ranking curve plots and forest plots. A p value of ≤ .050 was considered statistically significant. The Cochrane collaborative tool was used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 2 655 participants of whom 94.8% had CLTI were included. Eleven trials compared plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) vs. drug coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty (n = 1 771), five trials compared bare metal stent (BMS) vs. drug coated stent (DCS) (n = 466), three trials compared atherectomy vs. DCB (n = 194), two trials compared PBA vs. BMS (n = 70), one trial compared PBA vs. atherectomy (n = 50), and one trial compared BMS vs. DCB (n = 104). None of the revascularisation strategies significantly reduced the risk of major amputation or death compared with PBA. Using the network estimates, GRADE certainty of evidence for improvement in major amputation outcomes for DCB was moderate, for atherectomy and BMS was low, and for DCS was very low compared with PBA. Risk of bias was low in 16 trials, of some concerns in six trials, and high in one trial, respectively. CONCLUSION: There is no current evidence from RCTs to reliably conclude that BMS, DCB, DCS, or atherectomy are superior to PBA in preventing major amputation and death in patients with CLTI. Larger comparative RCTs are needed to identify the best endovascular revascularisation strategy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type",10.1016/j.ejvs.2024.05.014,"Humans;*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;*Network Meta-Analysis;*Peripheral Arterial Disease/mortality/surgery/therapy/complications;*Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/mortality;*Amputation, Surgical/statistics & numerical data;Treatment Outcome;*Limb Salvage;*Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia/surgery;Stents;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects",38754723.0,,Excluded,"The study is a meta-analysis of RCTs, not an RCT itself.

However, at the longer follow up timepoints that analysis was limited by small trial numbers and few participants. The aim of this study was to report an updated summary level risk of all-cause mortality after treatment with paclitaxel-coated devices in that same patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the mortality outcomes associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat patients with occlusive disease of femoropopliteal arteries (last search date December 10, 2020). The single primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: We identified 34 randomized controlled trials (7654 patients; 84% intermittent claudication). There were 622 deaths among 4147 (15.0%) subjects in the paclitaxel device group and 475 deaths among 3507 (13.5%) subjects in the noncoated control group [relative risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.20, p=0.20, I(2)=0%).

We report the prespecified diabetes subanalysis comparing outcomes among patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Patients with claudication or ischemic rest pain (Rutherford class 2-4) were randomized to Chocolate Touch or Lutonix DCB. The primary efficacy endpoint was DCB success defined as primary patency at 12 months (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4 by duplex ultrasound without clinically driven target lesion revascularization in the absence of bailout stenting). The primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse events at 12 months, a composite of target limb-related death, major amputation, or reintervention. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients (38% DM [n=119]) were randomized to either Chocolate Touch (n=66/152) or Lutonix DCB (n=53/161).

Secondary objectives included the identification of factors which could have influenced general findings. BACKGROUND: Recently several randomized trials comparing drug-coated balloon (DCB) with conventional plain balloon (PB) for the treatment of femoropopliteal artery disease have been reported, but no updated meta-analyses are available and questions remain surrounding the long-term antirestenotic effectiveness of the 2 therapies. METHODS: We searched main electronic databases for randomized trials comparing DCB and PB for femoropopliteal artery disease. Random effects models were used to estimate the risk of TLR and all-cause death at 12 months, whereas long-term TLR and death risk were assessed by mixed effects Poisson regression models and incident rates of each outcome per patient-year. Main analyses were supplemented by sensitivity analyses, Bayesian estimates, and trial sequential analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8 eligible trials were identified. DCB was associated with a marked 12-month TLR risk reduction as compared with PB (risk ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19 to 0.57). The risk of death was similar between groups (risk ratio: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.95). Long-term outcomes assessment showed a reduced incidence of TLR with DCB (0.35; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.51) and a similar incidence of all-cause death (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.60 to 2.15). Similar findings were observed in Bayesian analyses. Significant heterogeneity was present with evidence of differential efficacy across devices. Trial sequential analysis indicated that available evidence is sufficient to prove superior antirestenotic efficacy of DCB over PB. CONCLUSIONS: DCB significantly reduces the risk of TLR as compared with PB without any effect on all-cause death. Evidence exists for differential efficacy according to the type of device used. Future trials investigating DCB angioplasty should include potentially more effective comparator therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type",10.1016/j.jcin.2016.06.008,"Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation/mortality;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Constriction, Pathologic;Equipment Design;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Humans;Odds Ratio;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",27539695.0,,Excluded,"The study is a meta-analysis of RCTs, not a primary randomized controlled trial itself.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

The primary endpoint from the Disrupt PAD III randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated superior procedural success in patients treated with intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) vs percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The present study evaluates primary patency after 1 and 2 years in this randomized population. METHODS: The Disrupt PAD III RCT enrolled 306 patients with moderately-to-severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries treated with IVL (n = 153) or PTA (n = 153) prior to DCB treatment or stenting. The powered secondary effectiveness endpoint was primary patency at 1 year, defined as freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization plus freedom from restenosis determined by duplex ultrasound. Acute PTA failure requiring stent placement during the index procedure was prespecified as a loss of primary patency. RESULTS: Primary patency at 1 year was significantly greater in the IVL arm (80.5% vs 68.0%, P = .017).

Materials and Methods: The IN.PACT Global Study was conducted at 64 international sites and enrolled 1535 patients with complex lesions, which included bilateral disease, multiple lesions, de novo in-stent restenosis, long lesions, and chronic total occlusions. The predefined full clinical cohort included 1406 patients (mean age 68.6 years; 67.8% men) with claudication or rest pain treated with the study DCB. Mean lesion length was 12.09±9.54 cm; 18.0% had in-stent restenosis, 35.5% were totally occluded, and 68.7% were calcified. Freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) was evaluated through 36 months. The safety composite endpoint was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days and freedom from major target limb amputation and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization within 36 months. All safety and revascularization events were reviewed by an independent clinical events committee. Results: The Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from CD-TLR through 36 months was 76.9%. The composite safety endpoint was achieved in 75.6% of patients. The 36-month all-cause mortality rate was 11.6%, and the major target limb amputation rate was 1.0%.

At 3 years, the prevalence of SAE was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (33.3 vs 63.3%; p = 0.02), which mainly resulted from a twofold reduction in target vessel revascularization rate (28.6 vs 59.3%; p = 0.02). The difference in mortality was nonsignificant (7.4 vs 14.3%; p = 0.42). Patients with mcPCB were less symptomatic and less likely to adhere to secondary prevention measures. In this pivotal trial, a novel mcPCB proved superior to POBA concerning LLL at 6-month follow-up, and SAE at 12 months. This result was sustained up to 3 years. There was no difference between groups regarding mortality.

Options for therapy include medical therapy, supervised exercise, surgical revascularization, and, more recently, endovascular therapies to restore arterial perfusion to the limb. Endovascular revascularization has evolved over the past 2 decades, from percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) to self-expanding stents, atherectomy, laser angioplasty, and drug-eluting stents. Despite impressive technologic advances, PTA remains the standard of care at many institutions and is the recommended primary treatment modality for femoral-popliteal PAD according to current American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines. However, restenosis after PTA is common. Therefore, a significant clinical need remains for a device that is able to achieve more durable patency than PTA but does not require a permanent implant. Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have the potential to address this need. Several randomized controlled clinical trials of PTA balloons coated with different formulations of paclitaxel have been conducted in Europe (N Engl J Med 2008;358:689-699) (Circulation 2008;118:1358-1365) (Circ Cardiovasc Interv 2012;5:831-840) (JACC Cardiovas Interv 2014;7:10-19) and demonstrated more durable efficacy than PTA with comparable safety. These studies were limited by small sample sizes and powered solely for an angiographic primary end point. The pivotal LEVANT 2 trial was designed in collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration to demonstrate safety and efficacy in a large population and to obtain US Food and Drug Administration approval. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, single-blind trial comparing the Lutonix DCB (Bard Lutonix; New Hope, MN) versus PTA for treatment of femoropopliteal PAD (LEVANT 2) is the first US-based 2:1 randomized controlled trial of 476 patients with femoral-popliteal PAD designed to demonstrate superior efficacy and noninferior safety of a novel paclitaxel DCB compared with PTA. The primary efficacy end point is primary patency at 12 months. The primary safety end point is composite freedom at 12 months from perioperative death, index limb amputation, reintervention, and limb-related mortality. A series of important secondary end points include physical functioning, quality of life, revascularizations, and alternative measures of patency. To minimize bias potential for confounding variables, LEVANT 2 (1) excluded patients stented after predilation before randomization, (2) incorporated very stringent criteria for bailout stenting, (3) did not count bailout stenting as a target lesion revascularization or failure of any end point, (4) required a blinded clinician to perform clinical evaluations at follow-up, and (5) required clinical assessment before review of duplex ultrasound results. CONCLUSIONS: LEVANT 2 represents the first US-inclusive multicenter, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel DCB compared with PTA as primary therapy for symptomatic PAD on the background of standard medical therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""STUDY DESIGN""]}",10.1016/j.ahj.2014.11.016,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/*methods;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;*Drug-Eluting Stents;Female;Femoral Artery/physiopathology/*surgery;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Male;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Peripheral Arterial Disease/metabolism/physiopathology/*surgery;Popliteal Artery/physiopathology/*surgery;Prospective Studies;Single-Blind Method;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Patency/*physiology",25819854.0,,Included,"Meets all inclusion criteria: RCT design, explicit DCB vs POBA comparison, and focus on femoropopliteal lesions.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

The authors conducted a network meta-analysis of RCTs comparing bare nitinol stents, covered nitinol stents, paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents (PES or SES), and paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) with plain balloon angioplasty or with each other in the femoropopliteal artery (PROSPERO registry: CRD42013004845). METHODS: Sixteen RCTs comprising 2532 patients with 4227 person-years of follow-up were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Bayesian random effects Poisson and binomial models were used for mixed treatment comparisons (WinBUGS). Clinical heterogeneity was accounted for by incorporating a meta-regression model on trial-specific baseline risk. End points included technical success, vascular restenosis, target lesion revascularization, and major amputations. Pairwise odds ratios and rate ratios (ORs and RRs) of absolute treatment effects were calculated, and the probabilities of each treatment being best are reported. Summary estimates are reported as the posterior median and associated credible intervals (CrIs) that serve the same purpose as confidence intervals in the context of the Bayesian framework. Extensive sensitivity, meta-regression, and network consistency analyses were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. RESULTS: Technical success was highest with covered stents (pooled OR, 13.6; 95% CrI, 3.3-31.1, probability best 82%) followed by uncovered stents (pooled OR, 7.0; 95% CrI, 2.6-129, probability best 18%) when compared with balloon angioplasty (reference treatment). Vascular restenosis was lowest with PES (RR, 0.43; 95% CrI, 0.16-1.18, probability best 45%) followed by PCB (RR, 0.43; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.67, probability best 42%). Target lesion revascularization was lowest with PCB (RR, 0.36; 95% CrI, 0.23-0.55, probability best 56%) followed by PES (RR, 0.42; 95% CrI, 0.16-1.06, probability best 33%). Major amputations were rare in all treatment and control groups (pooled amputation rate of 0.7 events per 100 person-years).

Methods and Results IN.PACT SFA is a prospective, multicenter, randomized single-blinded trial (Randomized Trial of IN.PACT Admiral Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty [PTA] Balloon Catheter vs Standard PTA for the Treatment of Atherosclerotic Lesions in the Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) that enrolled 331 subjects with symptomatic (Rutherford 2-4) femoropopliteal lesions. Subjects were randomly assigned 2:1 to the IN.PACT Admiral DCB or PTA. Assessments through 5 years included freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, the primary safety end point, and major adverse events. Through 5 years, patients treated with the IN.PACT Admiral DCB demonstrated a sustained treatment effect with superior freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization when compared with PTA (Kaplan-Meier estimate of 74.5% versus 65.3%; log-rank P=0.020). The primary safety composite was achieved in 70.7% of subjects in the DCB and 59.6% in the PTA groups ( P=0.068). The major adverse event rate was 42.9% for DCB and 48.1% for PTA ( P=0.459). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths in either group as adjudicated by an independent and blinded Clinical Events Committee. Conclusions The IN.PACT SFA randomized trial demonstrates that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB continues to perform better than PTA through 5 years with higher freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization.

A drug-eluting balloon (DEB) based on a novel coating was compared with uncoated balloons in patients undergoing femoro-popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with symptomatic femoro-popliteal atherosclerotic disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were randomized to paclitaxel-coated IN.PACT Pacific or uncoated Pacific balloons. The primary end point was late lumen loss at 6 months assessed by blinded angiographic corelab quantitative analyses. Secondary end points were binary restenosis and Rutherford class change at 6 months, and target lesion revascularization plus major adverse clinical events (major adverse events=death, target limb amputation, or target lesion revascularization) at 6 and 12 months. Eighty-five patients (91 cases=interventional procedures) were randomized in 3 hospitals (44 to DEB and 47 to uncoated balloons). Average lesion length was 7.0 ± 5.3 and 6.6 ± 5.5 cm for DEB and control arm, respectively. Procedural success was obtained in all cases. Six-month quantitative angiography showed that DEB were associated with significantly lower late lumen loss (-0.01 mm [95% CI, -0.29; 0.26] versus 0.65 mm [0.37; 0.93], P=0.001) and fewer binary restenoses (3 [8.6%] versus 11 [32.4%], P=0.01). This translated into a clinically relevant benefit with significantly fewer major adverse events for DEB versus uncoated balloons up to 12 months (3 [7.1%] versus 15 [34.9%], P<0.01) as well as target lesion revascularizations (3 [7.1%] versus 12 [27.9%], P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Use of IN.PACT Pacific DEB is associated with significant reductions in late lumen loss and restenoses at 6 months, and reinterventions after femoro-popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty up to 1 year of follow-up.

BACKGROUND: The benefit of using DCB in femoropopliteal arteries including the proximal popliteal artery has been demonstrated, but has not yet been evaluated for isolated popliteal lesions. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study includes patients requiring treatment with DCB of isolated popliteal lesions. Two cohorts matched (Plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) versus DCB) by their baseline and lesion characteristics were compared. Lesions receiving bail-out stents were excluded. Primary endpoint was the 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate. Secondary endpoints included the procedural success and complication rate, primary patency, changes in Rutherford-Becker class (RBC) and ankle-brachial index (ABI). RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients were included in this study. More than one third of the patients had critical limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) (35 % (POBA) versus 40.4 % (DCB), p = 0.354. The technical success rate of the procedure was 85.1 % (n = 40/47) in the DCB group and 83.3 % (n = 60) in the POBA group (p = 0.510). There were three complications in the POBA group (5.0 %) but none in the DCB group (p = 0.172). After 12 months, in the entire cohort 14 patients (13.1 %) had to undergo a TLR. The TLR-free survival was 81.7 % in the POBA and 93.6 % in the DCB group (p = 0.060). Primary patency rates after POBA and DCB were 65.1 % and 87.5 % at 6 months (p = 0.024), respectively. At 12 months, the patency rates were 71.7 % and 85.1 % (p = 0.076), respectively. For both treatment arms, there was a significant improvement in ABI and RBC compared to baseline. Four patients from the DCB group and two from the POBA group received a minor amputation (p = 0.232). One patient in the DCB group died within 12 months.

METHODS: We evaluated the safety of the Stellarex drug-coated balloon (DCB) for femoropopliteal artery disease with an independently performed meta-analysis of patient-level data from all patients in the Stellarex femoropopliteal clinical program. To compare mortality after DCB or uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), we aggregated data from 2 RCTs comprising 419 patients treated with DCB and 170 patients treated with PTA. In an additional analysis, data were aggregated from 6 poolable Stellarex DCB studies (2 RCTs, 3 single-arm studies, and 1 registry). All serious adverse events including deaths were adjudicated by a blinded, third-party, independent Clinical Events Committee. Kaplan-Meier estimates in the RCTs were compared with restricted mean survival time. Predictors of death were assessed with hazard ratios (HRs) and Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the patients treated with DCB and PTA in the pooled RCT analysis, with the exception that the DCB cohort was younger (67.4±9.7 versus 69.4±9.4 years, P=0.02), smoked more frequently (86.6% versus 78.8%, P=0.02), and were less often treated for recurrent lesions (8.8% versus 14.7%, P=0.04). In the RCTs, patients treated with DCB had all-cause mortality rates that were not different from those of patients treated with PTA (Kaplan-Meier estimates 1.8±0.7% versus 1.3±0.9%, 6.5±1.2% versus 5.9±1.9%, and 9.3±1.5% versus 9.9±2.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, P=0.86). All-cause mortality rates were similar in a 1906-patient pooled nonrandomized DCB data set (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2.1%, 4.9%, and 7.0% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively). Clinical Events Committee-adjudicated causes of death were balanced between the DCB and PTA cohorts. Multivariable Cox modeling identified age (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.08; P<0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.01-2.00; P=0.04), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.12-3.16; P=0.02), and renal insufficiency (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.33-3.01; P<0.001) as predictors of mortality. Paclitaxel exposure was unrelated to mortality (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-1.10; P=0.23).

Materials and Methods: BIOLUX P-III is an international, prospective, observational registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02276313) conducted at 41 centers in Europe, Asia, and Australia with follow-up visits at 6, 12, and 24 months. Of 700 patients (mean age 70.0±10.2 years; 439 men) with 863 lesions in the all-comers cohort, 330 (47.1%) patients had diabetes and 234 (37.7%) had chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The majority (79.3%) of lesions were in the femoropopliteal segment; of all lesions, 645 (74.9%) were calcified and 99 (11.5%) had in-stent restenosis (ISR). The mean lesion length was 84.7±73.3 mm. The primary clinical endpoint was major adverse events (MAEs) within 6 months, a composite of device- and procedure-related mortality through 30 days, major target limb amputation, and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). The primary performance endpoint was clinically-driven TLR within 12 months. Results: At 6 and 12 months, freedom from MAEs was 94.0% and 89.5% in the all-comers cohort: 95.0% and 91.2% in the femoropopliteal group and 95.3% and 88.0% in the ISR subgroup, respectively. Freedom from clinically-driven TLR at 12 months was 93.1% in the all-comers cohort, 93.9% in the femoropopliteal lesions, and 89.4% for ISR lesions.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study enrolled patients from January 2018 to March 2022 who had femoropopliteal artery in-stent restenosis treated by RA and DCB. Preoperative demographics, operative details, and postoperative 12-month follow-up outcomes were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: 38 consecutive patients (31 men; mean age 69.55 ± 9.18 years, range 54-91 years) with Tosaka II (n = 8) and III (n = 30) ISR were treated with RA Most patients had a high prevalence of typical vascular comorbidities. Overall, 50% of patients had chronic limb-threatening ischemia, and the average lesion length was 155.0 ± 54.8 mm. The primary patency rate, assessed by duplex ultrasound at 12 months, was 86.7%; 7.9% (3/38) of patients underwent target lesion revascularization (TLR). The overall mortality rate was 2.6% (1/38), and the ulcer healing rate reached 83.3% (5/6), with none of these patients requiring amputation. Subgroup analysis based on target lesion length (≥ 200 mm) showed that the 12-month primary patency rate was 75.0% for the ≥ 200 mm group and 95.5% for the < 200 mm group. Cox univariate regression analysis did not identify any risk factors affecting primary patency rate and freedom from clinically driven TLR (CD-TLR) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Rotarex(®)S combined with DCB seems safe and provides acceptable 12-month primary patency and TLR rates in femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis.

BACKGROUND: CTOs are difficult to treat, and the optimal intervention remains to be determined. METHODS: The IN.PACT Global Study is an international single-arm study that enrolled 1,535 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. The study contains prospectively defined cohorts with prospectively planned imaging analyses, including a CTO (≥5 cm) cohort in which subjects underwent duplex ultrasonography analyzed by an independent core laboratory. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related mortality through 30 days, and freedom from major target limb amputation and target vessel revascularization through 12 months. An independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all adverse events. The primary effectiveness endpoint was primary patency at 12 months, defined as freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization and freedom from restenosis. RESULTS: The CTO imaging cohort had 126 subjects with 127 lesions (mean lesion length 22.83 ± 9.76 cm). Primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimate was 85.3% through 12 months.

BACKGROUND: The THUNDER trial was the first study to investigate the treatment of femoropopliteal arteries with a paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB). METHODS: In 154 patients, femoropopliteal arteries were treated with PCB, with angioplasty with paclitaxel in contrast medium, or no paclitaxel (control). The primary endpoint was 6-month late lumen loss (LLL). Secondary endpoints included freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), binary restenosis rate, and amputation. The 5-year FU compares outcomes in patients treated with PCB and control subjects. Additionally, LLL at 6 months and TLR up to 5-year FU were analyzed in terms of sex and lesion length. RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, the cumulative number of patients with TLR remained significantly lower in the PCB group (21%) than in the control group (56%, p = 0.0005). In the small group of patients with angiographic and duplex sonographic follow-up, PCB was associated with a lower rate of binary restenosis (17% vs. 54%; p = 0.04).

Materials and Methods: Between October 2016 and May 2017, 50 subjects (mean age 69.6±10.4 years; 29 men) with symptomatic moderate to severe lower limb ischemia (Rutherford categories 2 or 3) were enrolled at 4 German centers for the SELUTION SLR first-in-human trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02941224). The SELUTION SLR utilizes micro-reservoirs (biodegradable polymer spheres containing sirolimus) embedded within an amphipathic membrane coated onto an angioplasty balloon. The biodegradable reservoirs are transferred to the target vessel lumen during brief balloon inflation. The primary trial objective was comparison of angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months against an objective performance criterion (OPC) value of 1.04 mm for uncoated balloon angioplasty. Secondary endpoints included device, procedural, and clinical success; clinical and imaging assessments of primary patency and restenosis; functional assessments including Rutherford category and ankle-brachial index (ABI); and major adverse events [composite of cardiovascular mortality, index limb amputation, target limb thrombosis, and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR)]. Results: At 6 months, median angiographic late lumen loss following SELUTION SLR treatment was 0.19 mm (range -1.16 to 3.07). Mean angiographic late lumen loss (n=34) was 0.29±0.84 mm (95% CI -0.01 to 0.58), significantly lower than the 1.04-mm OPC value (p<0.001).

We compared the midterm outcomes of drug-coated balloon angioplasty versus plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) for femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions. METHODS: In total, 95 patients from the AcoArt I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01850056) with ≥5-cm femoropopliteal chronic total occlusion lesions were enrolled in this post-hoc subset analysis (drug-coated balloon, n = 50; POBA, n = 45). The primary endpoints were primary patency and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 24 months. The secondary endpoints were late lumen loss at six months and binary restenosis, major adverse events (composite of death and target limb amputation), change in the Rutherford class, and the ankle-brachial index at 24 months. RESULTS: Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched (mean lesion length, 20 cm). The six-month late-lumen loss rate was lower in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (0.18 ± 0.81 vs. 1.34 ± 0.94 mm, respectively; P < 0.001). The 24-month primary patency rate was significantly higher in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (53.85% vs. 17.50%, respectively; P < 0.001). The CD-TLR rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77 and 45.24%, respectively (P = 0.002). The 24-month overall mortality rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77% and 6.98%, respectively (P = 0.360), with no device- or procedure-related deaths.

To meet this need and to avoid potential ""class-effects"", the BIOPACT was set up. The purpose is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Passeo-18 Lux DCB (Biotronik) for treatment of patients with symptomatic PAD due to femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS: 302 patients are randomized in a 1:1 manner to treatment with either the Passeo-18 Lux DCB or the IN.PACT Admiral DCB (Medtronic) for testing of a formal non-inferiority hypothesis. The participants will be followed for 5 years. The primary efficacy endpoint is freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months, defined as any re-intervention at the target lesion due to symptoms, drop of ankle brachial index (ABI) > 20% or > 0.15 compared to post-procedural ABI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EffPac trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 171 patients of Rutherford category 2 to 4 with medium length femoropopliteal lesions. Patients were allocated 1:1 to either Luminor® 35 DCB angioplasty or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). Assessment at 5 years included primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), clinical improvement, and target limb amputation. Long-term vital status was ascertained in 97.1% of the participants. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier curves at 5 years demonstrate a primary patency of 61.4% after DCB angioplasty and 53.5% after POBA (log-rank p = 0.040) with a decreasing difference throughout the observation period. Freedom from TLR was 82.1% and 73.7%, respectively (log-rank p = 0.050). Incidence of primary clinical improvement was similar between groups (61% DCB vs. 64% POBA, p = 0.94).

Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) with the Shockwave™ system has recently been evaluated as a familiar angioplasty-balloon-based but effective technique for the management of arterial calcification. In the DISRUPT PAD clinical trials, excellent acute results were obtained in moderate to severely calcified femoro-popliteal lesions, including a group of patients with CTOs. The incidence of provisional stenting was very low, despite the lesion complexity. There was a high incidence of subsequent restenosis, suggesting an anti-restenotic therapy with drug coated balloon is a necessary adjunct.

The width and length of the drug-eluting peripheral balloon was chosen to ensure a vessel/balloon ratio of 1: 1 and exceed the lesion by 10 mm on both ends (based on visual estimation). RESULTS: The proportion of patients with ankle-brachial index improvement was 89.8% (106 of 118).

Recently published 6-month results of the DCB-Trak registry in patients treated with scoring-balloon angioplasty and DCB-angioplasty were promising without any safety concerns. Herein, we report the 12-month follow-up data. METHODS: In a single center registry, 29 consecutive patients with 32 femoro-popliteal lesions were treated with a scoring-balloon (VascuTrak®) and a DCB subsequently. The primary endpoint was the clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints were clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), binary restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio > 2.4), change in Rutherford classification and ankle-brachial-index (ABI). Safety endpoints were major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, death) and need for amputation. RESULTS: The procedure was successful in 29 lesions. There were no clinically driven TLRs after 12 months. Two patients required clinically driven TVR and one patient had a binary restenosis.

METHODS: The XTOSI pilot study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-center trial evaluating MagicTouch PTA SCB for symptomatic PAD. Assessments through 3 years included freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), freedom from major amputation, amputation-free survival (AFS), overall survival, and ulcer-free status. RESULTS: At 3 years, the overall freedom from CD-TLR was 84.4%, freedom from major amputation was 86.1%, AFS was 63.3%, overall survival was 63.3%, and ulcer-free status in remaining survivors with intact limbs was 100%. For femoropopliteal lesions, at 3 years, the freedom from CD-TLR was 92.9%, freedom from major amputation was 93.3%, AFS was 70%, and overall survival was 70%. For below-the-knee lesions, at 3 years, the freedom from CD-TLR was 77.8%, freedom from major amputation was 81.0%, AFS was 58.6%, and overall survival was 58.6%. CONCLUSIONS: SCB in the XTOSI pilot study showed promising clinical results sustained to 3 years, and no long-term safety concerns were raised. Randomized trials are currently ongoing to investigate the safety and efficacy of SCB for treatment of PAD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""SINGLE ARM""]}",10.1016/j.avsg.2023.12.096,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Amputation, Surgical;*Angioplasty, Balloon/instrumentation/adverse effects/mortality;*Cardiovascular Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;*Femoral Artery/physiopathology/diagnostic imaging;Limb Salvage;*Peripheral Arterial Disease/therapy/physiopathology/mortality/diagnostic imaging;Pilot Projects;*Popliteal Artery/physiopathology/diagnostic imaging;Progression-Free Survival;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;*Sirolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",38579912.0,,Excluded,Non-randomized single-arm study including excluded below-the-knee lesions and lacking POBA comparison.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

METHODS: Patients from the RANGER II SFA randomized controlled trial and long balloon sub-study were included in the long lesion cohort if their baseline lesion measurement was > 100 mm and if they had been treated with a RANGER DCB. Patients had symptomatic lower limb peripheral artery disease and Rutherford classification 2-4 symptomatology. The endpoints of interest included the 12-month target lesion primary patency and freedom from major adverse events (MAEs).Additional patient outcomes including changes in Rutherford classification were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the long lesion cohort. Mean lesion length was 144.5 ± 31.7 mm. Seventy-five lesions had Peripheral Arterial Calcium Scoring System (PACSS) grades 3 (33.3%, 43/129) and 4 (24.8%, 32/129). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the primary patency rate at 12 months was 88.0%. The rate of freedom from MAEs at 12 months was 95.1% (117/123; 95% CI: 89.7%, 98.2%); all MAEs were clinically driven target lesion revascularization (4.9%, 6/123). The 12-month mortality rate was 2.4% (3/125). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lesions > 100 mm treated with Ranger DCBs demonstrated excellent 1-year safety and efficacy results, comparable to those of the overall RANGER II SFA randomized clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: Atherectomy is frequently utilized in the treatment of complex PAD. To date, there are no head-to-head comparisons of existing devices and their selection is based mostly on operator preference rather than on supportive data. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized trial designed to assess the impact of DAS in comparison to OAS on atherosclerotic plaque. Pre- and postatherectomy lesion characterization was performed by angiography and IVUS. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty was performed after atherectomy with similar analysis repeated. RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized to undergo either DAS or OAS. Pretreatment angiographic and IVUS characteristics were similar in the DAS and OAS groups. DAS led to a greater reduction in plaque volume throughout the entire lesion (5.9% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.003). This corresponded to a greater increase in total vessel and lumen volume by IVUS (161.5 mm(3) vs. 50.2 mm(3) , p = 0.001; 178.6 mm(3) vs. 47.0 mm(3) , p = 0.004, respectively), as well as a reduction in angiographic stenosis (40% vs. 70%, p < 0.001). After DCB, 10 patients required stenting for suboptimal results in the OAS group compared with two in the DAS group (p = 0.021).

There is limited evidence of DCBs in long or occlusive lesions. This study is to investigate the efficacy of the paclitaxel-coated balloon for treatment of long and occlusive femoropopliteal arterial lesions. METHODS: A single-arm trial including 44 femoropopliteal lesions (chronic total occlusion (CTO) plus > 10 cm) treated with DCBs was performed to collect data of average 1-year follow-up. Endpoints contain primary patency, target lesion revascularization (TLR), amelioration of the Rutherford classification, change of ankle brachial index (ABI) and major adverse events. RESULTS: Technical success is 97.7% while device success is 100%. Mean lesion length was 186 ± 86.3 cm. Stent implantation was performed in 13.6%. Cumulative probability of primary patency was 78.8% ± 6.8% at 1 year while that of freedom from TLR was 91.4% ± 4.9%.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of drug-coated balloons for the treatment of Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document II A and B lesions, but there is a need for large-scale prospective studies to evaluate a broader range of lesions. METHODS: The IN.PACT Global Study enrolled 1,535 subjects, and 1,406 (1,773 lesions) were included in the pre-defined clinical cohort analysis. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was evaluated at 24 months. The safety composite endpoint was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target vessel revascularization within 24 months. RESULTS: Mean lesion length was 12.1 cm, 35.5% were total occlusions, and 18.0% had in-stent restenosis. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 24 months was 83.3%, the composite safety endpoint was met in 81.7%, the 2-year all-cause mortality rate was 7.0%, and the major target limb amputation rate was 0.7%. Increased lesion length and the presence of de novo in-stent restenosis or coronary artery disease were associated with increased risk for clinically driven target lesion revascularization by 24 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 1535 subjects enrolled in the study, 156 participants (mean age 71.8±10.4; 87 men) with CLI (Rutherford categories 4,5) were treated with DCB angioplasty in 194 femoropopliteal lesions. This cohort was compared to the 1246 subjects (mean age 68.2±10.0 years; 864 men) with intermittent claudication (IC) treated for 1573 lesions. The CLI cohort had longer lesions (13.9±10.6 vs 11.9±9.4 cm, p=0.009) and a higher calcification rate (76.8% vs 67.7%, p=0.011). Major adverse events [MAE; composite of all-cause mortality, clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), major (above-ankle) target limb amputation, and thrombosis at the target lesion site], lesion and vessel revascularization rates, and EuroQol-5D were assessed through 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, CD-TLR, and amputation events; estimates are presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Estimates of 12-month freedom from major target limb amputation were 98.6% (95% CI 96.7% to 100.0%) in subjects with CLI and 99.9% (95% CI 99.8% to 100.0%) in subjects with IC (p=0.002). Freedom from CD-TLR through 12 months was 86.3% (95% CI 80.6% to 91.9%) in CLI subjects and 93.4% (95% CI 91.9% to 94.8%) in IC subjects (p<0.001). The MAE rate through 12 months was higher in CLI subjects (22.5% vs 10.7%, p<0.001), and CLI patients had poorer overall survival (93.0%, 95% CI 88.9% to 97.2%) than IC subjects (97.0%, 95% CI 96.0% to 97.9%, p=0.011).

BACKGROUND: The midterm outcome of DCB versus uncoated balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for FPAD are still debated. METHODS: A total of 200 Chinese patients with FPAD were prospectively randomized into treatment with DCB or with PTA. The primary efficacy endpoints were primary patency of the target lesion, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, improved ankle-brachial index, and improved Rutherford class at 24 months. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of major adverse events. RESULTS: The DCB group and PTA group were comparable in demographic characteristics and clinical severity at baseline. At 24-month follow-up, primary patency was better in the DCB group versus PTA group (64.6% vs. 31.4%; p < 0.001). The DCB group had a higher rate of freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization than the PTA group (86.5% vs. 58.9%; p < 0.001). Rutherford class and ankle-brachial index also confirmed more improvements in the DCB group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference in major adverse events.

BACKGROUND: DCB coatings differ in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating morphologies. Due to these differences, a class effect with DCBs has not been demonstrated. Consequently, each DCB needs to be evaluated independently based on its own clinical study results. METHODS: The ILLUMENATE Global Study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study. Patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain due to superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or popliteal peripheral artery disease (PAD) were treated with the Stellarex DCB. The primary efficacy endpoint was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis with peak systolic velocity ratio ≤2.5 or clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from device and procedure-related death through 30 days postprocedure and freedom from target limb major amputation and CD-TLR through 12 months. RESULTS: In total, 417 lesions were treated in 371 patients. The mean lesion length was 7.5 ± 5.3 cm, 40.8% of lesions were severely calcified per core laboratory fluoroscopy criteria and 31.3% were total occlusions. Primary patency by independent duplex core lab evaluation was 81.4% and the freedom from CD-TLR was 94.8% day 365 per Kaplan-Meier estimate.

METHODS: Two hundred patients with femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease were enrolled in the AcoArt I trial and randomly assigned to either the DCB or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) group. A total of 86 patients with post-balloon angioplasty dissection were reanalyzed. The primary endpoint was clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) over five years. Kaplan-Meier curve estimates were used to evaluate the association between the treatment and CD-TLR. Interaction and stratified analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Over five years, patients treated with DCB angioplasty demonstrated an acceptable effect with a numerically higher but not statistically significant rate of freedom from CD-TLR compared with those treated by PTA (Kaplan-Meier estimate of 77.6% vs 64.4%; log-rank P = 0.08). Among the patients who underwent TLR, the mean time from intervention to TLR in the DCB group was significantly prolonged compared to the PTA group (P < 0.001). The stratified analysis showed that the Rutherford classification played an interactive role in the association between the DCB angioplasty and low CD-TLR rate at five years. No significant difference in the all-cause mortality was found in the patients with post-balloon angioplasty dissection between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The five-year follow-up outcomes of the post-balloon angioplasty dissection in the AcoArt I trial demonstrated that DCB angioplasty is more trustworthy than PTA, with a higher rate of freedom than CD-TLR and sustained improvement in clinical symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The J-S and J-SII trials were both prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Patients in J-S underwent Jetstream atherectomy followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), whereas those in J-SII had adjunctive drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment following atherectomy. Patients were adults with Rutherford category 2, 3, or 4 and had stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesion(s) with a degree of stenosis ≥70 in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery. In J-S, lesions were required to be calcified, and in J-SII lesions were required to be severely calcified.

METHODS: The JET-RANGER study was a multicenter (eleven US centers) randomized trial, core lab-adjudicated, designed to demonstrate the superiority of JET + PCB versus PTA + PCB in treating FP arterial disease. The study intended to enroll 255 patients, but was stopped early because of poor enrollment due to COVID-19 and concerns about the association of paclitaxel with mortality. The data are thus considered exploratory. A total of 47 patients (48 lesions) with claudication (80.9%) or rest pain/ulcerations (19.2%) were randomly assigned 2:1 to JET + PCB (n=31) or PTA + PCB (n=16). The In.PACT (Medtronic) and Ranger (Boston Scientific) PCBs were used. Freedom from target-lesion revascularization (TLR) was evaluated at 1 year. Analysis was performed on intention to treat.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of paclitaxel exposure on the long-term safety and efficacy of angioplasty of femoropopliteal artery lesions in the combined IN.PACT randomized trials. METHODS: The IN.PACT randomized trials (SFA, N = 331 and Japan, N = 100) each compared the DCB with standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for claudication, and consented patients for 5 and 3 years, respectively.

Paclitaxel dose (mg) was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.02, p = .381), but was an independent predictor of reduced risk of CD-TLR (HR 0.79; p < .001). Causes of death did not differ by treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In pooled randomized trial data with updated vital status ascertainment, paclitaxel was associated with improved efficacy but was not associated with increased mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""POOLED ANALYSIS""]}",10.1002/ccd.29152,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation/mortality;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Female;Humans;Intermittent Claudication/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices",32830913.0,PMC7693077,Included,"Meets all inclusion criteria: RCT design, DCB vs POBA comparison, and strictly femoropopliteal population.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

We aimed to directly compare efficacy and safety of a high-dose (In.Pact™) vs. low-dose (Ranger™) DCB with nominal paclitaxel densities of 3.5 vs. 2.0 μg/mm2. METHODS AND RESULTS: Within a prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority, clinical trial 414 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford classification 2-4) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular treatment with either high- or low-dose DCB after stratification for lesion length. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints comprised primary patency and freedom from major adverse events (i.e. device and procedure-related deaths through 1 month, major amputations, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months). We set a non-inferiority margin of -10% at 12 months. Total occlusions were observed frequently (>40%) and provisional stenting was performed in every fourth intervention. Non-inferiority was determined for both primary efficacy and safety endpoints at 12 months. Primary patency was 81.5% in the high-dose and 83.0% in low-dose DCB group {difference: 1.5% [lower bound of the 90% two-sided confidence interval (CI) -5.2%]; Pnon-inferiority < 0.01}.

However, the specific benefits of IVUS for treatment of complex FPA lesions remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors compared the clinical impact of IVUS-guided vs angiography-guided DCB angioplasty in patients with complex or noncomplex FPA lesions. METHODS: This study was a prespecified, primary subgroup analysis of the randomized IVUS-DCB trial. Patients with FPA undergoing DCB angioplasty were randomized to receive the procedure under IVUS or angiography guidance. The primary endpoint was 12-month primary patency; secondary endpoints included clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), sustained clinical improvement, and hemodynamic improvement. RESULTS: Among the 237 patients enrolled, 158 had complex FPA (Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II [TASC II] type C/D), and 79 had noncomplex FPA (TASC II type A/B). In complex FPA, IVUS guidance was associated with significantly higher rates of primary patency (82.1% vs 60.3%; HR for loss of primary patency: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.16-0.70; P = 0.002), freedom from CD-TLR (90.0% vs 76.9%; HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13-0.75; P = 0.01), and sustained clinical and hemodynamic improvement relative to angiography guidance.

The use of atherectomy may increase the benefit of definitive therapy, such as drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty. PURPOSE: To analyze the 2-year safety and efficacy of atherectomy in general and stratified by directional atherectomy (DA) and front-cutting atherectomy (FA) for the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions of the femoropopliteal arteries. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed including patients who underwent vessel preparation with atherectomy. The primary endpoint was the 2-year incidence of target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints included primary patency, changes in ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford-Becker class (RBC), and amputation rate up to 2 years. RESULTS: Nine hundred and fifty-five patients (37.8% female; mean age: 69.7±9.6 years) were included in this analysis. Eight hundred and twenty-one patients (86%) were claudicants, 134 patients (14%) had critical limb-threatening ischemia. Six hundred and forty-four lesions (67.4%) were in a native artery and 145 lesions (15.2%) were in-stent restenoses. In 166 patients (17.4%), atherectomy was performed in native and in-stent segments. Eight hundred and thirty-seven patients were treated with DA and 118 patients with FA. Five-hundred and seventy-four procedures (60.1%) were followed by DCB angioplasty, provisional stent rate was 20% overall. One hundred and fifty-four procedure-related adverse events (16.1%) were documented, four complications (0.4%) required surgical intervention. At 2 years, 279 patients (34.3%) required TLR. After DA, TLR rates were 9%, 19.5%, and 32.2% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, and 14.2%, 29.4%, and 49%, at 6, 12, and 24 months after FA. After DA, primary patency rates were 75.9%, 57.4%, and 40.3% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, and 64.9%, 44.8%, and 26%, at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, after FA. Mean ABI and mean RBC improved significantly during follow-up (p<0.001), 17 patients required amputation, 13 minor (1.6%) and four major (0.5%). Regression analysis shows that more calcified lesions are more likely to have a TLR. Compared with a vessel diameter of 4 mm or smaller, larger diameters are associated with fewer TLRs. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, atherectomy of femoropopliteal lesions shows satisfactory mid-term results. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00031245. CLINICAL IMPACT: The results of this analysis could influence the daily practice of the interventionalists.

METHODS: BIOLUX P-III is a prospective, international, multicenter, all-comers registry-based study that was conducted at 44 sites with follow-ups at 6, 12 and 24 months. The present study is a subgroup analysis comparing the outcomes associated with endovascular revascularization with those associated with Passeo-18 lux DCBs in patients with and without dyslipidemia. The proportions of patients free from major adverse events (defined as device- or procedure-related mortality within 30 days, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and major target limb amputation), target vessel revascularization, and patient-reported outcomes within 24 months postintervention were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 876 patients with symptomatic PAD who underwent peripheral revascularization with DCBs and had information on their dyslipidemia status were included; 588 of those patients had dyslipidemia. There was no difference in the proportion of patients free from MAEs between the groups. The percentages of patients who were 6, 12 and 24 months free from CD-TLR were significantly lower in the dyslipidemia group than in the nondyslipidemia group (86.3% vs 91.9% at 2 years, p = .0183). Similarly, the percentage of patients free from target vessel revascularization was lower in the dyslipidemia group at all timepoints (83.3% vs 89.3% at 2 years, p = .0203). There was no difference in mortality or major or minor limb amputation rates. Other secondary outcomes were similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to those without dyslipidemia, patients with symptomatic PAD and dyslipidemia who underwent revascularization with a Passeo-18 lux DCB had greater rates of CD-TLR and TVR.

We report mid-term and long-term patient-level mortality in three trials from our institution. METHODS: Patient data from the DRECOREST I and II trials, as well as the FINNPTX-trial, were included for analysis. The DRECOREST I involved patients with stenosis in a bypass vein graft, and the DRECOREST II included patients with stenosis in a dialysis fistula. The FINNPTX-trial randomized patients to either a prosthetic bypass or drug-eluting stent for long femoropopliteal lesions. Since the present retrospective study addressed mortality related to intravascular paclitaxel exposure and population data in Finland are comprehensive, we were able to include all patients exposed to paclitaxel in the three trials. Mortality data were extracted from the population registry, as well as patient records. Survival rates were analyzed for all trials pooled and separately. Late mortality was retrospectively analyzed and cross-referenced with national registry data. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were included, 76 treated with paclitaxel-eluting device, and 66 without. The mean follow-up time for survivors was 3.9 years. Overall all-cause mortality was 31.7% during follow-up. In the DRECOREST I-trial, 35.5% of patients died in the paclitaxel group and 37.9% in the control group (P = 0.84).

BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a promising endovascular treatment option for peripheral artery disease of the femoropopliteal segment, and each unique device requires dedicated clinical study. METHODS: The prospective, randomized RANGER SFA (Comparison of the Ranger™ Paclitaxel-Coated PTA Balloon Catheter and Uncoated PTA Balloons in Femoropopliteal Arteries) study (NCT02013193) enrolled 105 patients with symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford category 2 to 4) and stenotic lesions in the nonstented femoropopliteal segment at 10 European centers. Seventy-one patients (mean age 68 ± 8 years, n = 53 men) were enrolled in the Ranger DCB arm, and 34 patients (mean age 67 ± 9 years, n = 23 men) were assigned to the control group. Twelve-month analysis included patency, safety, and clinical outcomes and quality-of-life assessments. RESULTS: The DCB group had a greater primary patency rate at 12 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate 86.4% vs. 56.5%), with a significantly longer time to patency failure (log-rank p < 0.001). The estimated freedom from target lesion revascularization rate was 91.2% in the DCB group and 69.9% in the control group at 12 months, with a significantly longer time to reintervention (p = 0.010). No target limb amputations or device-related deaths occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-month results show that patency was maintained longer after Ranger DCB treatment than after conventional balloon angioplasty, and this result was associated with a low revascularization rate and good clinical outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jcin.2018.01.276,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Constriction, Pathologic;Europe;Female;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Prospective Studies;Recurrence;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",29730375.0,,Included,"Meets all inclusion criteria: RCT design, explicit DCB vs POBA comparison, and strictly femoropopliteal lesions.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is limited by occurrence of vessel recoil and neointimal hyperplasia. Drug-coated balloons (DCB) deliver drugs to the arterial wall to potentially reduce the restenosis rate. A number of paclitaxel-coated balloon technologies are available to treat peripheral lesions. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, a total of 153 patients with symptomatic PAOD in femoro-popliteal lesions were randomized either to DCB or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). RESULTS: The mean lesion length was 13.2 ± 10.4 cm with target lesion total occlusions in 26.1% of all patients (40/153). The primary endpoint of in-lesion late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months was significantly reduced in the DCB group as compared to the POBA group (0.35 mm CI [0.19; 0.79 mm] vs. 0.72 mm CI [0.68; 1.22 mm], p = 0.006).

METHODS: The BIOLUX P-III is a prospective, international, multi-centre, registry of patients with infra-inguinal lesions treated using the Passeo-18 Lux, a drug-coated balloon. Our study is a 24-month subgroup analysis of these patients; primary endpoints were freedom from major adverse events and clinically driven target lesion re-vascularisation within 12 months post-intervention. RESULTS: Of the 877 patients in the registry, 561 (64.0%) were male and 316 (36.0%) were female. Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (Rutherford class ≥ 4) occurred in 35.7% of males and 40.6% of females. Rates of freedom from major adverse events and clinically driven target lesion re-vascularisation at 12 months were 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.2-89.9) and 90.4% (95% CI 86.5-93.3), and 92.3% (95% CI 89.9-94.1) and 92.9% (95% CI 89.7-95.1) in males and females, respectively. All-cause mortality at 24 months was 12.0% (95% CI 9.4-15.3) in males and 11.9% (95% CI 8.6-16.5) in females. The major target limb amputation rate at 24 months was 9.1% (95% CI 6.9-11.9) in males and 4.0% (95% CI 2.3-7.0) in females. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the Passeo-18 Lux DCB demonstrated high efficacy and low complication rates. Despite the greater proportion of chronic limb threatening ischaemia observed in females, males were at a greater risk of ipsilateral major limb amputation and major adverse events following drug-coated balloon utilisation.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of restenosis can be reduced by the use of drug-coated balloons. However, dose, coating composition, and technology are decisive for efficacy. METHODS: Two hundred Chinese patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were prospectively randomized to treatment with new paclitaxel-coated or standard uncoated balloon catheters. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months, measured by a blinded core laboratory. Secondary angiographic endpoints (6 months) and specific clinical endpoints (1 year) were binary restenosis, ankle-brachial index, Rutherford stage, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and amputation. RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 66 years, 74% were men, 31% were smokers, and 55% had diabetes. Patients were in Rutherford stages 2 through 5, with a mean lesion length of 150 mm; 25% had in-stent restenosis, 55% had occlusion or partial occlusion, and 20% underwent provisional stenting. Late lumen loss at 6 months was available for 89%, and clinical follow-up was available for >95% per group. Mean late lumen loss was 0.05 ± 0.73 mm with coated balloons and 1.15 ± 0.89 mm with uncoated balloons (p < 0.001). Correspondingly, the rates of restenosis were 22.5% and 70.8% (p < 0.001). After 1 year, the rates of target lesion revascularization were 7.2% and 39.6% (p < 0.001), and Rutherford class and ankle-brachial index improved more markedly in the coated group (p < 0.046 and p = 0.023, respectively). One major amputation was recorded in the control group. No coating-related adverse events were observed for doses of up to 43 mg paclitaxel per patient.

METHODS: PRISTINE was a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, observational, multi-investigator, single-center clinical study. Complication-free survival at 30 days was the safety clinical endpoint. Immediate technical success (ability to cross and dilate the lesion and achieve residual angiographic stenosis < 30%), 6-month primary vessel patency, limb salvage, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) and amputation free survival (AFS) were the efficacy endpoints of interest. RESULTS: Seventy five patients were included. There were 50 (68.0%) males; mean age, 69.0 ± 10.7 years. CLTI severity was based on the Rutherford Scale (R5 = 51; R6 = 17). Significant co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (n = 68; 91.0%) and end-stage renal failure (n = 28; 37.0%). 112 atherosclerotic lesions were treated (TASC II D = 58 (52%); 76 (67%) de novo). There was 100% technical success. Mean lesion length treated was 22.4 ± 13.9 cm. Primary vessel patencies at 6 and 12 months were 64/86 (74%) and 43/74 (58%) and freedom from clinically driven TLR were 72/86 (84%) and 55/74 (74%) respectively.

Due to the calcification, it requires a different clinical approach than the more common arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower extremity. The introduction of novel technologies such as the drug-coated balloon, directional atherectomy, supera and drug-eluting stent has improved the prognosis of these patients. This study will contribute to the development of higher-quality evidence-based medicine for clinical treatment by assessing the quality of life (QOL), clinical treatment effect, and health economics of patients with calcification. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The Evolution study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, observational, real-world study. From January 2021 to December 2022, 600 patients with moderate to severe femoropopliteal artery calcification will be recruited from ten locations in China. After discharge, information on demographics, disease history, procedure details, imaging findings, and follow-up will be collected.

Previously, the DCB showed favorable 1-year outcomes compared with conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), yet durability of the treatment effect with DCBs remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the longer-term outcomes of a paclitaxel-eluting DCB compared to PTA for femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS: We enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic (Rutherford 2 to 4) femoropopliteal lesions up to 18 cm in length. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The 24-month assessments included primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), major adverse events, and quality of life and functional outcomes as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D quality-of-life questionnaire, walking impairment questionnaire, and 6-min walk test. RESULTS: At 24 months, patients treated with DCB showed significantly higher primary patency when compared with PTA (78.9% vs. 50.1%; p < 0.001). The rates of CD-TLR were 9.1% and 28.3% (p < 0.001) for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively. The overall mortality rate in the DCB group was 8.1% versus 0.9% in the PTA group (p = 0.008). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations in either group through 24-month follow-up. The rate of vessel thrombosis was low (1.5% DCB vs. 3.8% PTA; p = 0.243), with no new events reported between 1 and 2 years. Both groups showed similar functional improvement at 2 years, although DCB patients achieved this level of function with 58% fewer reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS: The 24-month outcomes from the trial demonstrate a durable and superior treatment effect of DCB versus PTA with significantly higher primary patency, lower CD-TLR, and similar functional status improvement with fewer repeat interventions.

METHODS: Between January 2014 and October 2015, the prospective, randomized RANGER SFA study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02013193) enrolled 105 patients with symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford category 2-4) and stenotic lesions in the nonstented femoropopliteal segment at 10 European centers. Seventy-one patients (mean age 68±8 years; 53 men) were enrolled in the Ranger drug-coated balloon (DCB) arm and 34 patients (mean age 67±9 years; 23 men) were assigned to the control group. Six-month analysis included angiographic late lumen loss and safety and clinical outcomes assessments. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the DCB and control groups were similar, as were lesion lengths (68±46 vs 60±48 mm; p=0.731), severity of calcification (p=0.236), and the prevalence of occlusions (34% vs 34%; p>0.999). At 6 months, late lumen loss was significantly less for the DCB group vs controls (-0.16±0.99 vs 0.76±1.4; p=0.002).

The best treatment strategy remains unclear. This study aimed to compare drug-coated balloons (DCBs) used alone or in association with excimer laser atherectomy (ELA) to simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of femoropopliteal-ISR. METHODS: The INTACT trial is a multicenter, prospective, triple-arm randomized trial conducted across 14 centers from December 2015 to November 2019. Patients Rutherford Class 2-5 with ISR≥70% were followed-up for 18 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent ISR>70% by duplex ultrasound analysis. The primary safety endpoint was major adverse events (MAEs) defined as death, major amputation, or target lesion revascularization (TLR). RESULTS: Around 134 subjects were randomized to PTA alone (n=41), PTA+DCB (n=43) or PTA+ELA+DCB (n=50). Procedural success was similar (p=.74), as was clinical success (p=.17). The number of recurrent ISR>70% decreased after PTA+ELA+DCB (30.0%; p=.04) and PTA+DCB (30.2%; p=.05) compared to PTA alone (51.2%). Primary patency was higher after PTA+ELA+DCB (log-rank p=.04) and PTA+DCB (log-rank p=.02) compared to PTA alone at 12 months (78.7% and 70.4% vs 61.5%) and 18 months (61.6% and 67.7% vs 37.3%). Freedom from MAEs was lower after PTA+DCB (27.9%) compared to PTA alone (53.7%; p=.02) but did not differ with PTA+ELA+DCB (40.0%). It was primarily driven by TLR; 2 major amputations occurred after PTA+ELA+DCB (4.0%; p=.18). CONCLUSION: This independent study demonstrated a decrease in recurrent ISR>70% and increase in primary patency up to 18 months after PTA+ELA+DCB and PTA+DCB compared to PTA alone in the treatment of FP-ISR. It did not show an increase in MAEs but could have lacked power. CLINICAL IMPACT: This multicenter, prospective, triple-arm randomized, controlled trial focuses on the results of adjunctive therapies, such as excimer laser atherectomy (ELA) and/or drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in femoropopliteal lesions in 134 patients. It has the originality of being an independent study funded by a grant from the French Ministry of Health. This study confirms a significant decrease in recurrent ISR >70% and increase in primary patency up to 18 months after the use of ELA+DCB and DCBs compared to simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of femoropopliteal ISR without an increase in major adverse events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong drug",10.1177/15266028241248333,,38659343.0,,Included,"The study is an RCT comparing DCB vs POBA (PTA alone) in femoropopliteal ISR, meeting all inclusion criteria.","The following criterias were checked: 1.

Materials and Methods: IN.PACT SFA China (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02118532) was a single-arm, independently adjudicated, prospective, premarket study that enrolled 143 subjects (mean age 66.8±7.7 years; 107 men) at 15 centers. The predominant risk factors were hypertension (104, 72.7%) and diabetes mellitus (66, 46.2%). The majority of subjects were classified as Rutherford category 2 or 3 [69 (48.3%) and 55 (38.5%), respectively]; 19 (13.3%) subjects had critical limb ischemia (Rutherford category 4). The mean lesion length was 10.4±6.51 cm; more than half of the lesions (75, 52.4%) were chronic total occlusions. Calcification was found in 66 (46.2%) lesions. Outcomes at 12 months were compared with DCB safety and effectiveness performance goals derived from the literature. The 30-day primary safety outcome was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related mortality, major target limb amputation, and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Results: The primary safety outcome was 99.3% at 30 days. Follow-up compliance at 12 months was 92.6%. Estimated 1-year primary patency using Kaplan-Meier analysis was 90.9% and freedom from CD-TLR was 97.1%. The rate of CD-TLR at 12 months was 2.9%. The Rutherford category status improved significantly (p<0.001) between baseline and 12 months. Conclusion: Results from IN.PACT SFA China demonstrated high rates of patency and low rates of CD-TLR in Chinese subjects through 12 months despite patient and lesion complexity.

However, challenging lesions, such as severely calcified, remain difficult to treat with DCB alone. Vessel preparation with directional atherectomy (DA) potentially improves outcomes of DCB. METHODS AND RESULTS: DEFINITIVE AR study (Directional Atherectomy Followed by a Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon to Inhibit Restenosis and Maintain Vessel Patency-A Pilot Study of Anti-Restenosis Treatment) was a multicenter randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of DA before DCB to facilitate the development of future end point-driven randomized studies. One hundred two patients with claudication or rest pain were randomly assigned 1:1 to DA+DCB (n=48) or DCB alone (n=54), and 19 additional patients with severely calcified lesions were treated with DA+DCB. Mean lesion length was 11.2±4.0 cm for DA+DCB and 9.7±4.1 cm for DCB (P=0.05). Predilation rate was 16.7% for DA+DCB versus 74.1% for DCB; postdilation rate was 6.3% for DA+DCB versus 33.3% for DCB. Technical success was superior for DA+DCB (89.6% versus 64.2%; P=0.004). Overall bail-out stenting rate was 3.7%, and rate of flow-limiting dissections was 19% for DCB and 2% for DA+DCB (P=0.01). One-year primary outcome of angiographic percent diameter stenosis was 33.6±17.7% for DA+DCB versus 36.4±17.6% for DCB (P=0.48), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 7.3% for DA+DCB and 8.0% for DCB (P=0.90). Duplex ultrasound patency was 84.6% for DA+DCB, 81.3% for DCB (P=0.78), and 68.8% for calcified lesions. Freedom from major adverse events at 1 year was 89.3% for DA+DCB and 90.0% for DCB (P=0.86). CONCLUSIONS: DA+DCB treatment was effective and safe, but the study was not powered to show significant differences between the 2 methods of revascularization in 1-year follow-up.

Paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty proved to be superior to plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) regarding prevention of restenosis and need for recurrent revascularization. Over the past years, paclitaxel was the only active drug to inhibit neointimal proliferation which could be processed to an appropriate balloon coating. The purpose of this study is to assess whether efficacy and safety of sirolimus-coated balloon angioplasty is noninferior to paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty. METHODS: This randomized controlled, single-blinded, multicentre, investigator-initiated noninferiority trial aims to enrol a total of 478 participants with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease of Rutherford category 2 to 4 due to de novo stenosis or restenosis. After pre-dilation, participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either sirolimus- or paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty. Post-dilation with the drug-coated balloon (DCB) used or standard balloon is mandatory in case ≥ 50%, and optional in case of ≥ 30% residual diameter stenosis. Bailout stenting with bare-metal nitinol stents should be conducted in case of flow-limiting dissection. Primary noninferiority endpoints are primary patency and the composite of all-cause mortality, major target limb amputation, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are clinical and hemodynamic improvement, change in health-related quality of life, and safety throughout 60 months. DISCUSSION: Although concerns about long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated devices were not confirmed by recent patient-level data analyses, conflicting evidence contributed to a loss of confidence among patients and physicians. Therefore, sirolimus, known for a broader therapeutic range than paclitaxel, may serve as a welcome alternative. This will be justified if noninferiority of sirolimus-coated balloon angioplasty against the current standard of paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty can be demonstrated.

These patients were randomly divided into percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and drug-coated balloons (DCB) groups. The primary endpoint was the primary patency (PP) rate and clinically-driven target lesion revascularisation at 24 months. RESULTS: After 24 months of follow-up, the PP rate of dissection cases in the PTA group was lower vs non-dissection cases. In patients receiving a bailout stent for dissection, the PP rate in the PTA group was lower vs the DCB group. Cox regression analysis showed that dissection decreased the PP rate; mild dissection reduced the PP rate as follows: 52%, PTA group and 19%, DCB group.

METHODS: In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2-4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-Coated Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable. RESULTS: In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, P=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, P=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (P=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, P=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations. Pharmacokinetic outcomes showed that all patients had detectable paclitaxel levels after DCB deployment that declined within the first hour (54.4±116.9 ng/mL to 1.4±1.0 ng/mL).

Several randomized clinical trials have reported that paclitaxel-coated balloon significantly reduce the rates of restenosis and the need for reintervention in comparison with regular balloon angioplasty. Due to the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating techniques, variable clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel ZENFlow carrier-free DCB in the treatment of femoropopliteal artery occlusive disease. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial conducted at 15 sites, 192 patients with Rutherford class 3-5 were randomly assigned into two groups: drug-coated balloon group and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group. The primary endpoint was a late lumen loss at 6 months based on blinded angiographic core laboratory evaluations, and the secondary endpoints included primary patency rate, binary restenosis, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class change, and major adverse events. RESULTS: In this multicenter trial, 93 patients received DCB angioplasty, whereas 99 patients underwent regular balloon angioplasty. The late lumen loss at 6-month follow-up was 0.50 ± 0.82 and 1.69 ± 0.87 mm in the drug-coated balloon and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty groups, respectively (p < 0.001). During the 12-month follow-up period, the drug-coated balloon group showed a significantly higher primary patency rate (54 vs. 31.3%, p = 0.009) and markedly lower rates of target vessel restenosis (22.1 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001) and clinically driven target lesion revascularization rate (5.4 vs. 19.2%, p = 0.006) than the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group. Compared with the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group, the drug-coated balloon group had significant improvements in the ankle-brachial index and Rutherford class. The all-cause mortality rate was comparable, and no device-related deaths occurred in either groups. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon angioplasty using a ZENFlow carrier-free drug-coated balloon is a safe and effective treatment method for femoropopliteal artery lesions.

Purpose To assess 2-year efficacy and safety of DCB angioplasty compared with conventional balloon angioplasty (also known as plain old balloon angioplasty or POBA). Materials and Methods This prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolled consecutive participants with symptomatic superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery disease at 11 German centers between September 2015 and December 2016. Participants underwent DCB angioplasty or conventional balloon angioplasty. Primary outcome of 6-month late lumen loss showed superiority of DCB angioplasty over conventional balloon angioplasty. Evaluation at 2 years included secondary outcomes of primary patency and target lesion revascularization (TLR) estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, clinical and hemodynamic improvement, quality of life, target limb amputation, and all-cause mortality. Results A total of 171 participants (mean age, 69 years ± 8; 111 men) were evaluated. At 2 years, primary patency was achieved in 90.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.4%, 95.2%) of DCB angioplasty and 62.7% (95% CI: 50.0%, 73.0%) of conventional balloon angioplasty participants (P < .001). Freedom from TLR occurred in 97.2% (95% CI: 89.1%, 99.3%) of DCB angioplasty and 78% (95% CI: 66.5%, 86.0%) of conventional balloon angioplasty participants (P = .001). The groups did not differ in sustained improvement from baseline to 2 years in Rutherford-Becker category (row mean scores difference, 1.7; P = .19) and showed no difference in mean improvement in the Walking Impairment Questionnaire score (-0.8%; 95% CI: -11.8%, 10.2%; P = .88), EuroQol Group's five-dimension index of quality of life (-0.06; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.03; P = .20), or ankle-brachial index (0.03; 95% CI: -0.08, 0.14; P = .57). No major amputation was necessary. One DCB angioplasty and two conventional balloon angioplasty participants died (risk ratio, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.04, 5.10). Conclusion At 2 years after paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, primary patency and freedom from target lesion revascularization remained superior compared with conventional balloon angioplasty.

METHODS: In the prospective, randomized, controlled EffPac study, patients were allocated to either DCB or plain old balloon angioplasty. Multivariable regression including interaction analysis was conducted to assess the impact of selected variables on the outcome measures of late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months, and on binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization (TLR), clinical improvement, and hemodynamic improvement at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients (69 ± 8 years, 111 men) were treated at 11 German centers. Hypertension increased, and advanced age decreased LLL (B coefficient [B]: 0.7 [95% CI - 0.04 to 1.3], p = 0.06 and - 0.3 per 10 years [95% CI - 0.5 to 0.01], p = 0.06, respectively). DCB angioplasty decreased odds of 12-month TLR and binary restenosis (OR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2 to 0.8], p = 0.01 and OR 0.1 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.6], p = 0.02, respectively).

Materials and Methods: An investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized study enrolled 88 patients for treatment of ISR with DCB (n=47; mean age 68.3±9.6 years; 26 men) or uncoated balloon (n=41; mean age 67.6±10.2 years; 26 men) angioplasty (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01594684). Additionally, the protocol provided for an observational arm composed of patients from either randomized arm who experienced recurrent ISR ≥30 days after the index treatment. Redo treatment consisted of 2 DCBs sequentially inflated at the same location (double dose therapy). The majority of patients (66, 78%) had Rutherford category 3 ischemia. The mean lesion length was 140 mm; a third (27, 31%) were total occlusions. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months evaluated by an independent core laboratory. Results: Twenty-two patients (7 DCB +15 uncoated) were treated for recurrence with fully overlapping double DCB angioplasty. Six-month LLL was lower after DCB (0.34±1.12 mm) treatment than after angioplasty with an uncoated balloon (1.58±1.10 mm, p<0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 18 (49%) of 37 patients in the uncoated group, 6 (14%) of 43 patients in the single-dose DCB group (p=0.001), and no patients from the recurrent ISR group. At ~2 years after treatment, a remarkable number (14/27, 52%) of TLRs were recorded in the single-dose DCB group. Conclusion: Treatment with DCBs resulted in significantly less 6-month LLL and fewer TLRs up to 24 months than treatment with uncoated balloons. The double dose for treating recurrent ISR did not cause recognizable adverse events or require TLR up to 24 months.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Maybe""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""IN STENT RISTENOSIS""]}",10.1177/1526602820907917,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Endovascular Procedures/adverse effects/*instrumentation;Female;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Germany;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Prospective Studies;Recurrence;Retreatment;*Stents;Switzerland;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",32096451.0,,Included,"Meets all inclusion criteria: RCT design, DCB vs POBA comparison, and strictly femoropopliteal lesions.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

This study aimed to compare the therapeutic effects of directional atherectomy combined with DCB angioplasty with DCB angioplasty alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal arteriosclerosis obliterans. METHODS: Patients with femoropopliteal arteriosclerosis obliterans who received endovascular therapy from June 2016 to June 2018 in our hospital and presented with life-limiting claudication or severe chronic limb ischemia comprised the study cohort. The patients were randomized to receive directional atherectomy combined with DCB angioplasty (n = 45) or DCB alone (n = 49). Ninety-four patients were enrolled in our study with 72 males, and the mean age was 67 ± 10 years. The mean lesion length was 112 ± 64 mm. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of patients and lesions between the 2 randomized groups (P > 0.05). Flow-limiting dissections occurred more frequently in the DCB group (n = 12; 24.5%) than in the DA-DCB group (n = 2; 4.4%; P = 0.006). The technical success rate in the DA-DCB group was superior to that in the DCB group (95.6% vs. 75.5%, P = 0.006). The mean follow-up duration was 16.7 ± 6.1 months in the DCB group and 15.3 ± 5.8 months in the DA-DCB group. No amputations were performed. The overall mortality in the DCB group was 4.1% (2/49), while all patients survived in the DA-DCB group. The 12-month and 24-month primary patencies in the DA-DCB group were greater than those in the DCB group (80.5% vs. 75.7% and 67.1% vs. 55.1%, respectively); however, using all available patency data, no significant differences over time were observed (P = 0.377). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, directional atherectomy combined with DCB angioplasty can decrease the flow-limiting dissection rate in the treatment of femoropopliteal arteriosclerosis obliterans compared with DCB angioplasty alone. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of primary patency rate which was needed to be further clarified.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""wrong control group""]}",10.1016/j.avsg.2019.06.014,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*instrumentation/mortality;Arteriosclerosis Obliterans/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy;*Atherectomy/adverse effects/mortality;Beijing;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;Chronic Disease;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Female;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging;Humans;Intermittent Claudication/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/therapy;Ischemia/diagnostic imaging/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy;Male;Middle Aged;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging;Prospective Studies;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;*Vascular Access Devices;Vascular Patency",31449956.0,,Excluded,"The study compares DCB with atherectomy vs DCB alone, not DCB vs POBA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective, multicenter, physician-initiated BIOLUX 4-EVER trial was conducted at 5 centers in Belgium and enrolled 120 patients (mean age 70.9±10.5 years; 79 men) with symptomatic stenotic or occluded de novo femoropopliteal lesions. A fifth of the patients had diabetes mellitus and nearly half had previous peripheral artery interventions. The lesions were a mean 83.3±49.5 mm long with a mean reference vessel diameter of 5.26±0.59 mm. Lesions were treated with a Passeo-18 Lux DCB followed by the implantation of a Pulsar-18 bare metal stent. Follow-up visits were conducted at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months postprocedure; the main outcome was primary patency at 12 months. RESULTS: Technical success was obtained in all patients. Primary patency was observed in 89.9% of patients (95% CI 84.0% to 95.8%) at 12 months and in 83.5% at 24 months (95% CI 89.9% to 97.3%), and freedom from target lesion revascularization was 93.6% (95% CI 89.9% to 97.3%) and 86.1% (95% CI 79.9% to 92.3%), respectively. Ten patients died throughout the course of the trial (90.7% survival at 24 months), all of noncardiovascular causes.

This controlled, prospective, multicenter study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of DCB to inhibit restenosis of the infrainguinal arteries in an exclusive diabetic population. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, 106 diabetic patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were enrolled at 11 sites in Belgium, 54 treated with DCB angioplasty and 52 treated with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). The primary endpoint of the study are the primary patency, mean diameter restenosis and binary restenosis of the treated sites at 6 months without re-intervention in the interim. RESULTS: The 6-month mean diameter restenosis was significantly lower in the DCB arm than in the POBA group (29±36% vs. 46±35%, P=0.032) and the binary (≥50% diameter stenosis) restenosis rate was signicantly lower in DCB patients compared with the POBA's (27% vs. 49%, P=0.03).

The superficial femoral and popliteal arteries are the most commonly diseased vessels in such patients and are being increasingly treated using endovascular revascularisation techniques. However, it is currently unknown whether drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons confer additional clinical benefits over more established techniques using plain balloons and bare metal stents, or whether they represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources. METHODS: The BASIL-3 trial is a UK National Institute for Health Research, Health Technology Assessment Programme-funded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of plain balloon angioplasty with or without bail-out bare metal stenting, drug-coated balloon angioplasty with or without bail-out bare metal stenting, and primary stenting with drug-eluting stents for SLI secondary to femoro-popliteal disease. Patients with 'multilevel' disease may receive aorto-iliac and/or infrapopliteal treatments concurrently with their randomised femoro-popliteal intervention. The primary clinical outcome is amputation-free survival defined as the time to major (above the ankle) amputation of the index limb or death from any cause. The primary outcome for the economic analysis is cost per quality-adjusted life year. Secondary outcome measures include overall survival, major adverse limb events, major adverse cardiac events, relief of ischaemic pain, healing of tissue loss, and quality of life. The required sample size has been calculated at 861 participants (287 on each arm). These patients will be recruited over 3 years and followed-up for between 2 and 5 years. DISCUSSION: BASIL-3 is a pragmatic RCT designed to reflect current UK clinical practice. The results will inform decision-making regarding the appropriateness of funding the use of drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents, by the NHS, for the management of SLI due to femoro-popliteal disease.

The SurVeil DCB uses an excipient intended to optimize both the uniformity and transfer of paclitaxel to the vessel wall, allowing for efficient drug loading and lower systemic exposure than currently available DCBs, Heretofore, clinical outcomes have not previously been compared to other DCBs. STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: This prospective, multicenter, international, randomized, single-blind, trial will compare 1:1 the SurVeil DCB with the IN.PACT Admiral DCB for treatment of patients with Rutherford classification 2 to 4 due to femoral and/or popliteal arterial disease. The trial will randomize 446 subjects (with reference vessel diameter 4-7 mm and total lesion length ≤180 mm). Subjects will be followed for 60 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is 1 year primary patency, defined as composite freedom from clinically-driven target-lesion revascularization (TLR) and binary restenosis (core lab-adjudicated duplex ultrasound peak systolic velocity ratio ≥2.4, or ≥50% stenosis via angiography). The primary safety endpoint is composite freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization through 12 months. The primary analysis is a test of noninferiority of the SurVeil vs. IN.PACT Admiral on the primary efficacy and safety endpoints according to absolute deltas of 15.0% and 10.0%, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of peripheral arterial disease is challenged by restenosis, requiring revascularization procedures to maintain patency. DCBs are designed to deliver an anti-proliferative drug to the vessel wall to diminish smooth muscle cell proliferation and maintain patency. METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled 50 patients with 58 lesions in the first cohort that required pre-dilatation with an uncoated angioplasty balloon prior to inflation of the DCB. The primary effectiveness endpoint was 6-month late lumen loss (LLL). The major secondary endpoint was major adverse event (MAE) rate at 6 months, defined as cardiovascular death, amputation, and/or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization. RESULTS: The mean lesion length was 7.2 cm and baseline stenosis was 75.1%. Calcification was present in 62.1% of lesions and 12.1% were occluded. Both endpoints met their prespecified performance goals; at 6 months, the MAE rate was 4% and the mean LLL was 0.54 mm. The primary patency rate was 89.5% at 12 months and 80.3% at 24 months.

Evidence remains limited on the durability of the treatment effect with DCBs in the longer term. METHODS AND RESULTS: IN.PACT SFA is a single-blind, randomized trial (Randomized Trial of IN.PACT Admiral Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty [PTA] Balloon Catheter vs Standard PTA for the Treatment of Atherosclerotic Lesions in the Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) that enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic (Rutherford 2-4) femoropopliteal lesions up to 18 cm in length. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with DCB or PTA. The 36-month assessments included primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, major adverse events, and functional outcomes. At 36 months, primary patency remained significantly higher among patients treated with DCB compared with PTA (69.5% versus 45.1%; log rank P<0.001). The rates of clinically driven target lesion revascularization were 15.2% and 31.1% (P=0.002) for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively. Functional outcomes were similarly improved between treatment groups even though subjects in the DCB group required significantly fewer reinterventions versus those in the PTA group (P<0.001 for target lesion revascularization, P=0.001 for target vessel revascularization).

BACKGROUND: Several trials have demonstrated that paclitaxel-eluting balloon angioplasty reduces late luminal loss in comparison with PTA. METHOD: In a prospective, randomized, single-blind, dual-center study, 74 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to in-stent restenosis were treated with either paclitaxel-based drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty (n = 35) or standard PTA (n = 39). Clinical outcomes and patency rates were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: The mean lesion length was 17.3 ± 11.3 cm in the DEB group and 18.4 ± 8.8 cm in the PTA group. A single major complication (bleeding) was observed once (1.4%). The mean ankle-brachial index before endovascular treatment was 0.65 ± 0.16 in both groups and 0.79 ± 0.2 versus 0.84 ± 0.3 (p = 0.70, Student t test) in the DEB versus PTA group at 12 months.

Mean lesion length was 7.2 and 7.1 cm, and 19.2% and 19.0% of lesions represented total occlusions, respectively. The primary safety end point was met, and superiority was demonstrated; freedom from a primary safety event was 94.1% (193 of 205) with DCB and 83.3% (50 of 60) with PTA, for a difference of 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.9%-23.0%). The primary effectiveness end point was met, and superiority of DCB over PTA was achieved (83.9% [188 of 224] versus 60.6% [40 of 66]; P<0.001). Outcomes with DCB were also superior to PTA per the Kaplan-Meier estimate for primary patency (89.0% versus 65.0% at 365 days; log-rank P<0.001) and for rates of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (5.9% versus 16.7%; P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Superiority with a low-dose DCB for femoropopliteal interventions was demonstrated over PTA for both the safety and effectiveness end points.

METHODS: MDT-2113 SFA Japan ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01947478) is an independently adjudicated, prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial that randomized (2:1) 100 patients (mean age 73.6±7.0 years; 76 men) from 11 Japanese centers to treatment with DCB (n=68) or PTA (n=32). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, including mean lesion length (9.15±5.85 and 8.89±6.01 cm for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively). The primary effectiveness outcome was primary patency at 12 months, defined as freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and freedom from restenosis as determined by duplex ultrasonography. The safety endpoint was a composite of 30-day device- and procedure-related death and target limb major amputation and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization within 12 months. RESULTS: Patients treated with DCBs exhibited superior 12-month primary patency (89%) compared to patients treated with PTA (48%, p<0.001). The 12-month CD-TLR rate was 3% for DCB vs 19% for PTA (p=0.012). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths, major amputations, or thromboses in either group. Quality-of-life measures showed sustained improvement from baseline to 12 months in both groups. CONCLUSION: Results from the MDT-2113 SFA Japan trial showed superior treatment effect for DCB vs PTA, with excellent patency and low CD-TLR rates.

The objective of this registry was to evaluate whether these results will be confirmed in a real-world setting with varying stenting strategies. Patients and methods: In this prospective, observational trial, 160 patients with 186 femoropopliteal lesions were treated with the Pulsar-18 SE nitinol stent at 9 German sites. Mean lesion length was 116 ± 103 mm, and 41.9 % of the lesions were moderately or heavily calcified. Eighty lesions were concomitantly treated with drug-coated balloon (DCB). Main effectiveness outcome was primary patency at 12 months, and main safety outcome was freedom from the composite of device or procedure related death, major target limb amputation, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 30 days and 6 months. Results: Kaplan-Meier estimate of primary patency was 89.1 %, 67.3 %, and 57.1 % at 6, 12, and 24 months. Freedom from TLR was 95.5 %, 91.4 %, and 85.2 % at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Lesions, which were additionally treated with DCB (plus DCB-group), were longer (150 versus 82 mm on average, p < 0.0001), and associated with lower primary patency estimates than those without DCB angioplasty (stent-only-group) (log-rank p = 0.006). However, there was no difference in freedom from TLR between groups (log-rank p = 0.542).

BACKGROUND: Although DCBs are the newest endovascular strategy for patients with peripheral artery disease presenting with femoropopliteal lesions, there remains a paucity of results in non-Caucasian populations. METHODS: IN.PACT SFA Japan is an independently-adjudicated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blinded trial. Endpoints through 2 years included primary patency and a composite safety endpoint of freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, freedom from target limb major amputation and freedom from clinically-driven target vessel revascularization at 24 months. RESULTS: One hundred patients were assigned by 2:1 randomization to treatment with the IN.PACT Admiral DCB (n = 68) or PTA (n = 32). The groups were well-matched at baseline.

BACKGROUND: Recent trials have reported lower rates of target lesion revascularization with DCB angioplasty versus standard PTA. However, the cost-effectiveness of DCB angioplasty is unknown. METHODS: A prospective economic study was performed alongside the IN.PACT SFA II (IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) trial, which randomized 181 patients with femoropopliteal disease to the IN.PACT DCB versus standard PTA. Resource use data were collected over 2-year follow-up, and costs were assigned using resource-based accounting and billing data. Health utilities were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensions questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a decision-analytic model on the basis of empirical data from the trial assuming identical long-term mortality. RESULTS: Initial costs were $1,129 per patient higher with DCB angioplasty than standard PTA, driven by higher costs for the DCB itself. Between discharge and 24 months, target limb-related costs were $1,212 per patient lower with DCB angioplasty such that discounted 2-year costs were similar for the 2 groups ($11,277 vs. $11,359, p = 0.97), whereas QALYs tended to be greater among patients treated with DCBs (1.53 ± 0.44 vs. 1.47 ± 0.42, p = 0.40). The probability that DCB angioplasty is cost-effective compared with standard PTA was 70% using a threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained and 79% at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with femoropopliteal disease, DCB angioplasty is associated with better 2-year outcomes and similar target limb-related costs compared with standard PTA. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of these results suggests that use of the DCB angioplasty is likely to be economically attractive.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1016/j.jcin.2016.08.036,"Aged;Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/*economics/*instrumentation;Cardiovascular Agents/administration & dosage/*economics;Coated Materials, Biocompatible/*economics;Constriction, Pathologic;Cost Savings;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Decision Support Techniques;Drug Costs;Equipment Design;Female;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;*Health Care Costs;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Economic;Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic           imaging/*economics/physiopathology/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Prospective Studies;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;United States;Vascular Access Devices/*economics",27884360.0,,Included,The study meets all inclusion criteria as it is an economic analysis alongside an RCT comparing DCB vs POBA in femoropopliteal lesions.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate a novel method of local drug delivery. METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized multicenter study with blinded reading enrolled 87 patients in Rutherford class 1 to 4 with occlusion or hemodynamically relevant stenosis, restenosis, or in-stent restenosis of femoropopliteal arteries. Treatment was performed by either conventional uncoated or paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters. The primary end point was late lumen loss at 6 months. Secondary end points included restenosis rate, ankle brachial index, Rutherford class, target lesion revascularization, and tolerance up to >18 months. Before intervention, there were no significant differences in lesion characteristics such as reference diameter (5.3+/-1.1 versus 5.2+/-1.0 mm), degree of stenosis (84+/-11% versus 84+/-16%), proportion of restenotic lesions (36% versus 33%), and mean lesion length (5.7 cm [0.8 to 22.6 cm] versus 6.1 cm [0.9 to 19.3 cm]) between treatment groups.

METHODS: Among the 476 patients in LEVANT 2, 126 patients (mean age 67.1±9.6 years; 79 men) were enrolled at the 8 participating German sites between August 2011 and July 2012 and were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the Lutonix DCB (n=83) vs an uncoated balloon during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=43). All patients had intermittent claudication or rest pain (Rutherford categories 2-4). Average lesion length was 58 mm and average treated length was 100 mm. Severe calcification was present in 11% of lesions, and 23% were total occlusions. The efficacy outcome was primary patency at 12 months, and the safety outcome was 12-month freedom from a composite of perioperative death, index limb-related death, amputation (below or above the ankle), and index limb revascularization. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse events, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched between Lutonix DCB and PTA groups, as were the final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedure success (91%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 12-month primary patency rate was 80% vs 58% (p=0.015) and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs 72% (p=0.001), respectively. Freedom from TLR was higher for DCBs (96%) vs PTA (82%, p=0.012). Major adverse events were similar for both groups. The benefit favoring DCB over PTA was observed in German men and women. Compared to the non-German LEVANT 2 cohort, there was a shorter time between insertion and inflation of treatment balloons (21.8 vs 39.5 seconds, p<0.001) in the German cohort. Balloons were inflated to higher pressures (9.0 vs 7.7 atm, p<0.001) but for a shorter period of time (130 vs 167 seconds, p<0.001), and although treated lesions in the German cohort had a higher baseline stenosis, final postprocedure diameter stenosis was lower (19% vs 22%, p=0.04) than in the non-German patients. CONCLUSION: Superiority of DCB over PTA in the German cohort of LEVANT 2 was demonstrated for primary patency, composite safety, and freedom from TLR. The benefit of DCB was also consistent for both genders.

BACKGROUND: DEB have shown promising results in femoropopliteal lesions, but data for infrapopliteal lesions are scarce. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized first-in-man study, 72 patients were randomized 1:1 to either a Passeo-18 Lux DEB (Biotronik AG, Buelach, Switzerland) (n = 36) or Passeo-18 PTA (n = 36). Follow-up assessments were scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months, with angiographic assessment at 6 months. Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee, and angiographic parameters were assessed by an independent core laboratory. RESULTS: The primary safety endpoint (a composite of all-cause mortality, target extremity major amputation, target lesion thrombosis, and target vessel revascularization at 30 days) was 0% in the DEB group versus 8.3% in the PTA group (p = 0.239). The primary performance endpoint (patency loss at 6 months) was 17.1% in the DEB group versus 26.1% in the PTA group (p = 0.298), and major amputations of the target extremity occurred in 3.3% versus 5.6% of the patients at 12 months, respectively.

SurVeil is a lower dose PCB (2.0 μg/mm(2)vs. 3.5 μg/mm(2) for IN.PACT Admiral) with a uniform microcrystalline coating intending to enhance durability and maximise drug delivery. METHODS: TRANSCEND is a prospective, single blind, randomised controlled, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical study. Patients with femoropopliteal artery disease in Rutherford stages 2 - 4 were randomised 1:1 to the SurVeil or the IN.PACT Admiral PCB. A sample size of 446 patients was calculated to prove non-inferiority of the SurVeil compared with the IN.PACT Admiral PCB for primary safety and efficacy endpoints at twelve months. Primary safety was defined as a composite of freedom from device and procedure related death through 30 days, and freedom from major target limb amputation and clinically driven (CD) target vessel revascularisation at twelve months. Primary efficacy was defined as primary patency at twelve months as a composite of freedom from binary re-stenosis and freedom from CD target lesion revascularisation. Secondary outcomes were reported up to twenty four months. RESULTS: A total of 446 subjects were randomised, 222 to the SurVeil and 224 to the IN.PACT Admiral PCB. Primary safety was 91.8% for the SurVeil vs. 89.8% for the IN.PACT Admiral PCB (p(non-inferiority) < .001), and primary efficacy was 82.2% vs. 85.9% (p(non-inferiority) = .003). Primary patency through twenty four months was 65.4% with the SurVeil and 66.9% with the IN.PACT Admiral PCB (p(non-inferiority) = .005).

Drug coated balloons (DCB) reduced restenosis rate in non heavy calcified lesions. Aim of this study was to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a combined endovascular approach using DA and DCB for the treatment of heavy calcified lesions of the femoro-popliteal tract. METHODS: From January 2010 to November 2010, 240 patients underwent PTA of the femoro-popliteal tract in our institution. Within this cohort a total of 30 patients had life limiting claudication (LLC) (n=18) and 12 a critical limb ischemia (CLI) with baseline Rutherford class 4.2±1.2 underwent PTA of heavy calcified lesions with intravascular ultrasound guided DA and DCB. All procedures have been performed using a distal protection device. Stent implantation was allowed only in case of flow limiting dissections or suboptimal result (residual stenosis>50%) by visual estimation. After the intervention patients were followed up to 12 months. RESULTS: Procedural and clinical success, was achieved in all cases. Bail-out stenting was necessary in only two (6.5%). At twelve month follow up median Rutherford class was 2.2±1.2, ABI was 0.8±0.1 and Limb salvage rate was 100%. Two minor, foot finger or forefoot amputations, were performed to reach complete wound healing and/or preserve deambulation. Duplex control was performed in all the cases (n=30). In three cases duplex scan showed a significant target lesion restenosis requiring a reintervention (TLR=10%) leading a total one-year secondary patency rate of 100%. All the three restenosed patients were insulin dependent diabetics and none of them were stented during the procedure. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that combined use of DA and DCB may represent a potential alternative strategy for the treatment of femoro-popliteal severely calcified lesions. These very promising data and the considered hypothesis have to be confirmed in a multicentre randomised trial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design",10.1016/j.carrev.2012.04.007,"Aged;Amputation, Surgical;*Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods;*Atherectomy/adverse effects/instrumentation/methods;Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage;*Catheters;*Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Constriction, Pathologic;Critical Illness;Equipment Design;Female;*Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Humans;Intermittent Claudication/etiology/therapy;Ischemia/etiology/therapy;Italy;Limb Salvage;Male;Middle Aged;Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage;Peripheral Arterial Disease/complications/diagnosis/*therapy;*Popliteal Artery/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Radiography;Recurrence;Registries;Severity of Illness Index;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex;Ultrasonography, Interventional;Vascular Calcification/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy;Vascular Patency",22632996.0,,Excluded,"The study is a non-randomized single-arm evaluation of DA combined with DCB, not a comparative trial of DCB vs POBA.

BACKGROUND: PTA is an effective strategy for treating atherosclerosis of the femoropopliteal axis (FPA). Whereas PEB have shown advantage over uncoated balloons in the treatment of simple lesions, it is unknown whether these results are applicable to complex degrees of FPA atheroma. METHODS: A total of 104 patients (110 FPA lesions in 110 limbs) were randomly assigned to either PEB + BMS or PTA + BMS. The primary endpoint was 12-month binary restenosis. Secondary endpoints were freedom from target lesion revascularization and major amputation. Post hoc subanalyses were performed for the comparison of long (≥100 mm) versus short lesions and true lumen versus subintimal approach. RESULTS: Mean lesion length was 94 ± 60 versus 96 ± 69 mm in the PEB + BMS and PTA + BMS groups (p = 0.8), respectively. The primary endpoint occurred in 9 (17%) versus 26 (47.3%) of lesions in the PEB + BMS and PTA + BMS groups (p = 0.008), respectively. A near-significant (p = 0.07) 1-year freedom from target lesion revascularization advantage was observed in the PEB + BMS group. No major amputation occurred. No significant difference was observed according to lesion characteristics or technical approach. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-dilation with PEB angioplasty prior to BMS implantation, as compared to PTA + BMS in complex FPA lesions, reduces restenosis and target lesion revascularization at 12-month follow-up. Restenosis reduction is maintained irrespective of lesion length and recanalization technique.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous treatment of peripheral vascular disease is associated with a high recurrence. Paclitaxel-coated balloons at 3 μg/mm(2) formulated differently have shown promising results with reduced restenosis. Methods Subjects at 9 centers with Rutherford class 2 to 5 femoropopliteal lesions were randomized between June 2009 and December 2009 to treatment with Lutonix DCB (n = 49) versus uncoated balloons (control group [n = 52]), stratified by whether balloon-only treatment (n = 75) or stenting (n = 26) was intended. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included adjudicated major adverse events (death, amputation, target lesion thrombosis, reintervention), functional outcomes, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Demographic, peripheral vascular disease, and lesion characteristics were matched, with mean lesion length of 8.1 3.8 cm and 42% total occlusions. At 6 months, late lumen loss was 58% lower for the Lutonix DCB group (0.46 1.13 mm) than for the control group (1.09 1.07 mm; p = 0.016). Composite 24-month major adverse events were 39% for the DCB group, including 15 target lesion revascularizations, 1 amputation, and 4 deaths versus 46% for uncoated balloon group, with 20 target lesion revascularizations, 1 thrombosis, and 5 deaths. Pharmacokinetics showed biexponential decay with peak concentration (Cmax) of 59 ng/ml and total observed exposure (AUC(all)) of 73 ng h/ml. For successful DCB deployment excluding 8 malfunctions, 6-month late lumen loss was 0.39 mm and the 24-month target lesion revascularization rate was 24%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of femoropopliteal lesions with the low-dose Lutonix DCB reduced late lumen loss with safety comparable to that of control angioplasty.

We investigated the use of paclitaxel-coated angioplasty balloons and paclitaxel dissolved in the angiographic contrast medium during angioplasty of the leg. METHODS: In a small, multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 154 patients with stenosis or occlusion of a femoropopliteal artery to treatment with standard balloon catheters coated with paclitaxel, uncoated balloons with paclitaxel dissolved in the contrast medium, or uncoated balloons without paclitaxel (control). The primary end point was late lumen loss at 6 months. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 68+/-8 years, 24% were smokers, and 49% had diabetes. Twenty-seven percent of the lesions were total occlusions, and 36% were restenotic lesions. The mean lesion length was 7.4+/-6.5 cm. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. There were no adverse events attributable to the paclitaxel-coated balloons. At 6 months, the mean late lumen loss was 1.7+/-1.8 mm in the control group, as compared with 0.4+/-1.2 mm (P<0.001) in the group treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons and 2.2+/-1.6 mm (P=0.11) in the group treated with paclitaxel in the contrast medium. The rate of revascularization of target lesions at 6 months was 20 of 54 (37%) in the control group, 2 of 48 (4%) in the group treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons (P<0.001 vs. control), and 15 of 52 (29%) in the group treated with paclitaxel in the contrast medium (P=0.41 vs. control); at 24 months, the rates increased to 28 of 54 (52%), 7 of 48 (15%), and 21 of 52 (40%), respectively.

METHODS: The angiograms obtained in the THUNDER study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00156624) were analyzed to compare degrees of dissection and angiographic parameters between the control (uncoated balloons, n=43) and treatment (PCBs, n=43) groups before and after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, target lesion revascularizations (TLR) were documented up to 2 years. RESULTS: In each group, 24 (56%) patients had a dissection after the intervention. At the 6-month follow-up, patients with dissection of any grade after treatment with PCBs had significantly less late lumen loss (0.4 mm) than patients with dissection after treatment with uncoated balloons (1.9 mm, p=0.001) and a lower degree of stenosis (20% vs. 51%, respectively; p=0.003).

The aim of this study was to investigate paclitaxel plasma levels and laboratory parameters following PTA with paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) in peripheral arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single treatment arm, multicenter study included 14 patients with Rutherford stage 1 - 5 with occlusions of up to 5 cm or ≥ 70 % diameter stenosis of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries (SFA, PA). PTA was performed using up to three PCB catheters. The paclitaxel plasma levels and safety laboratory parameters were determined by collecting blood samples pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours and 1 and 4 weeks post-intervention (p. i.). Vital signs were monitored to assess clinical safety. RESULTS: PTA was performed successfully in all patients. Paclitaxel plasma levels were always below a level and duration known to cause systemic side effects. A mean peak paclitaxel plasma level (40 ng/ml) was reached immediately p. i. and decreased rapidly below detectable levels in more than half of the patients already 2 hours p. i. The paclitaxel plasma concentrations returned to values below detectable levels at 24 hours p. i. in all patients. Laboratory parameters and vital signs did not give any reason for safety concerns. No adverse events associated with balloon coating were observed.

In order to select an optimal method of revascularization and to predict the duration of patency of the reconstruction modern clinical guidelines suggest using the GLASS and WIfI scales, which may improve the remote results of the intervention. Moreover, modern paclitaxel-coated stents and balloons may help increase primary patency of the reconstruction after endovascular procedures.

The purpose of this report is to present the 2-year results including a cost-benefit analysis for Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with symptomatic peripheral artery occlusive disease in femoropopliteal lesions were randomized either to drug-coated balloon (DCB, n = 78) or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA, n = 75). As secondary endpoints, the 2-year clinical results consisting of target lesion revascularization (TLR), patency and increase in walking distance were recorded. Based on the Kaplan-Meier analyses for TLR and other adverse events, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted for the German DRG system. RESULTS: There were no additional TLRs in both groups between 14 and 24 months so that the corresponding rates remained significantly different between the treatment groups (DCB: 19.1 vs. POBA 40.6%, p = 0.007). At 2 years, the patency rate was significantly higher in the DCB group (72.3 vs. 48.4%, p = 0.006). The walking distance increase was also significantly higher after DCB angioplasty (172 ± 103 vs. 52 ± 136 m, p = 0.001).

The Tack device is a nitinol-based, short (6 mm), stent-like implant with low outward force that can be deployed in a targeted fashion to treat vascular dissection. TOBA II primary results through 12 months have been published previously. This report provides follow-up safety and efficacy results through 24 months (RC). METHODS: The TOBA II trial enrolled 213 patients with Rutherford classification 2 to 4 and a de novo or non-stented restenotic lesion in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery who developed a dissection of any grade after treatment with plain balloon or drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty. Participants were followed for 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months following the procedure. Evaluations included clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), ankle-brachial index, Rutherford classification, peripheral artery questionnaire, quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D-3L, and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire. RESULTS: At enrollment, mean age was 68.2 ± 9.1 years, 70.9% were male, and 95.8% of patients were categorized as RC 2 or 3. The distribution of balloon types in the study were standard balloons: 42.3%; and drug-coated balloons: 57.7%. At 24-month follow-up, 167 patients (78.4%) had available data.

The following steps are proposed. 1) Evaluation of lesion morphology based on preprocedural imaging by Duplex sonography and intravenous ultrasound for selection of lesion preparation tools. Lesion characteristics are mainly defined by calcification, lesion length, and the presence of total occlusion and in-stent restenosis. 2) Selection of vessel preparation strategies, which encompass plain old balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, thrombectomy, intravascular lithotripsy and specialty balloons, or a combination of the preceding, based on lesion and patient-specific characteristics. In addition, a Delphi consensus was applied for the appropriateness of lesion preparation strategies, depending on lesion anatomy, length, plaque morphology, and subintimal versus intraluminal guidewire crossing. 3) Definitive lesion treatment strategies using drug-coated balloons, bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and/or covered stents or a combination.

The impairment of endothelial function does not only initiate but further provokes the development of atherosclerosis and thus myocardial infarction or interventions, making efficient lesion management crucial. DCB treatment alters the endothelium, but the impact is only incompletely understood, especially regarding Sirolimus or Paclitaxel. We now determined the impact and mechanisms of Sirolimus and Paclitaxel on endothelial function in symptomatic PAD. Patients / Materials and methods In this investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial, vascular function is determined in 70 PAD patients with complex femoropopliteal artery lesions and chronic symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford 2-4). Patients are either treated with SCB (Sirolimus Selution SLR™, MedAlliance) or PCB (Paclitaxel In.Pact™, Medtronic) angioplasty. The primary objective is the local endothelial function as determined through flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the proximal non-stenotic segment of the target SFA, non-target SFA and the brachial artery, with clinical outcomes being assessed prior to intervention, as well as at 1, 6 and 12 months. Additionally, vascular stiffness and compliance determined by vascular strain analysis and pulse wave velocity (PWV) of target and control vessels is evaluated, along with the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) to objectify vascular function. Further, inflammation markers (hs-CRP, IL-6, TGFß), endothelial function markers (Hb, Endothelin-1) and cardiac markers (Troponin I) in serum samples are assessed at every clinical follow-up. Results The vast majority of the 70 patients enrolled have completed their 1-month clinical follow up, leaving us with current data on the acute improvement of endothelial function and differences between SCB and PCB. An altered endothelial and vascular function after DCB treatment following SCB vs PCB treatment will be presented at DGA 2023. Conclusions Evidence is provided for an improved acute local and systemic endothelial function after interventional treatment of PAD. Our RCT data will support the concept for a better mechanistic understanding to enhance endovascular treatment strategies in PAD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""wrong control group""]}",10.1024/0301-1526/a001088     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=16642872&id=doi:10.1024%2F0301-1526%2Fa001088&atitle=Vascular+effects+through+sirolimus+vs.+paclitaxel+DCB+treatment+in+symptomatic+peripheral+artery+disease&stitle=Vasa+Euro.+J.+Vasc.+Med.&title=Vasa+-+European+Journal+of+Vascular+Medicine&volume=52&issue=&spage=21&epage=&aulast=Sacirovic&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Sacirovic+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=21-&date=2023&auinit1=M&auinitm=,C reactive protein;endogenous compound;endothelin 1;interleukin 6;paclitaxel;sirolimus;troponin I;adult;angioplasty;ankle brachial index;arterial stiffness;artery lesion;balloon;brachial artery;clinical assessment;clinical outcome;clinical trial;conference abstract;controlled study;endothelium;female;follow up;heart;human;human tissue;inflammation;leg ischemia;major clinical study;male;outcome assessment;peripheral arterial disease;pulse wave velocity;randomized controlled trial;surgery,,,Excluded,"Intervention compares SCB vs PCB (both DCB types), not DCB vs POBA.

Methods: XTOSI pilot study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single centre trial evaluating MagicTouch PTA SCB for symptomatic PAOD. Primary patency, defined as duplex ultrasound peak systolic velocity ratio less than 2.4 in absence of target lesion revascularisation, was assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months. Results: Fifty patients were recruited. The mean age was 67 [n=31 (62%) males]. SCB was applied to femoropopliteal in 20 patients (40%) and BTK in 30 patients (60%). Majority of treatments (94%) were performed for limb salvage indications (Rutherford scores 5 or 6). This was a high risk cohort, in which 90% had diabetes, 36% had coronary artery disease, 20% had end stage renal failure, and ASA score was 3 or more in 80%. Mean lesion length treated was 227±81 mm, of which 36% were total occlusions. Primary patencies for femoropopliteal at 6, 12 and 24 months were 88%, 79% and 53% respectively. Primary patencies for BTK at 6, 12 and 24 months were 74%, 59% and 50% respectively. At 24 months, the overall freedom from target lesion revascularisation was 89%; amputation free survival was 76%; all-cause mortality was 18%, limb salvage success was 92%, and wound healing rate in remaining survivors with intact limbs was 100%. Conclusions: MagicTouch PTA SCB in the XTOSI study showed promising clinical RESULTS to 24 months and no early safety concerns were raised.

Primary patency, defined as duplex ultrasound peak systolic velocity ratio < 2.4 in the absence of target lesion revascularization, was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization, amputation-free survival, all-cause mortality, and limb salvage success. Results: Fifty patients were recruited. The mean age was 67 years (n = 31 [62%] men). SCB was applied to the femoropopliteal artery in 20 patients (40%) and BTK arteries in 30 patients (60%). The majority of treatments (94%) were performed for limb salvage indications (Rutherford score 5 or 6). Mean lesion length treated was 227 ± 81 mm, and 36% were total occlusions. Technical and device success were both 100%. At 30 days, mortality was 2%, and major limb amputation was also 2%. Primary patency for the femoropopliteal artery at 6, 12, and 24 months was 88%, 79%, and 53%, respectively. Primary patency for BTK arteries at 6, 12, and 24 months was 74%, 59%, and 50%, respectively. The overall freedom from target lesion revascularization at 6, 12, and 24 months was 91%, 90%, and 89%, respectively. Overall amputation-free survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 86%, 82%, and 76%, respectively. Overall all-cause mortality at 12 and 24 months was 14% and 18%, respectively, and limb salvage success at 12 and 24 months was 93% and 92%, respectively. At 24 months, the wound healing rate in the remaining survivors with intact limbs was 100%. Conclusions: The MagicTouch PTA SCB in the XTOSI study showed promising clinical results to 24 months, and no early safety concerns were raised. Randomized trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of SCB for treatment of PAOD.

Key findings: Patients who underwent femoropopliteal (FP) endovascular intervention were randomized 1:1 to completion arteriography (group A, 74 patients) or arteriography plus intravascular ultrasound (IVUS; group B, 76 patients). IVUS was performed in all patients. However, the vascular surgeons were not aware of the IVUS results for group A. The mean arterial diameter was significantly larger before balloon angioplasty with IVUS compared with arteriography (5.6 mm vs 5.1 mm), although ∼10% of arteries were smaller. IVUS resulted in a change in treatment for 60 patients (79%). The incidence of binary restenosis found on duplex ultrasound at 12 months was significantly lower in group B (72% vs 55%). Binary restenosis was significantly lower in the IVUS group for the subgroup treated with drug-coated balloons (DCBs; 9% vs 38%). However, no difference in the binary restenosis rates was seen for cases treated with plain old balloon angioplasty or stents. Conclusion: The use of IVUS in this randomized controlled trial showed a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis after endovascular intervention for FP interventions. This benefit might primarily relate to patients treated with DCBs. Commentary: The disadvantages of routinely performing IVUS during FP endovascular interventions include the increased costs and risk of emboli by the additional passage of catheters through atherosclerotic lesions. The subgroup analysis revealed that the DCBs selected to treat lesions were significantly larger when IVUS was available and resulted in a lower restenosis rate. An inadequate DCB diameter could result in poor apposition of the balloon to the arterial wall with suboptimal drug delivery and poor suppression of neointimal hyperplasia. Value could exist for the use of IVUS as a completion study, not only for endovascular interventions for FP arterial occlusive lesions, but also for lower extremity vein bypasses. I recently performed a cutting balloon angioplasty for a retained valve in a failing vein bypass. The result looked reasonable but not perfect; thus, I followed up with a slightly larger balloon. Yes, the vein graft ruptured, and I needed to insert a stent graft emergently. Perhaps if I had used IVUS, I would have left well enough alone. Take-home message: Selective use of IVUS could lead to improved sizing of DCBs and resulting patency for FP atherosclerotic lesions treated endovascularly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design",10.1016/j.jvs.2022.04.009     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=10976809&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jvs.2022.04.009&atitle=The+Impact+of+Intravascular+Ultrasound+on+Femoropopliteal+Artery+Endovascular+Interventions%3A+A+Randomized+Controlled+Trial&stitle=J.+Vasc.+Surg.&title=Journal+of+Vascular+Surgery&volume=76&issue=1&spage=303&epage=&aulast=Allan&aufirst=R.B.&auinit=R.B.&aufull=Allan+R.B.&coden=&isbn=&pages=303-&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=B,adult;arteriography;artery diameter;artery wall;atherosclerosis;catheter;conference abstract;controlled study;drug delivery system;drug-coated balloon;duplex Doppler ultrasonography;embolism;female;graft occlusion;human;hyperplasia;incidence;intravascular ultrasound;lower limb;major clinical study;male;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;peripheral arterial disease;prospective study;randomized controlled trial;restenosis;stent graft;vascular surgeon;vein;vein bypass;vein graft,,,Excluded,"The study compares IVUS vs arteriography, not DCB vs POBA.

Late lumen loss (LLL) at six months was the primary endpoint of the study, whereas Serious Adverse Events (SAE: death, amputation, repeated revascularization) were considered a composite secondary endpoint. Routine angiography was scheduled for all study subjects at 6-month follow-up; outpatient appointments were scheduled at 12 and 36 months after intervention. Results: At 6 months, the LLL was by 62% lower in the mcPCB compared to POBA group (0.52±1.3 vs. 1.39±1.1mm; psup<0,01). Binary restenosis occurred in 23% vs 52% patients (p=0.02). At three years, the prevalence of SAE was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (33.3 vs. 63.3%; p=0.02), which mainly resulted from a 2-fold reduction in target vessel revascularization rate (28.6 vs. 59.3%; p=0.02). There was no difference in mortality (7.4 vs 14.3%; p=0.42). Patients with mcPCB were less symptomatic and less likely to adhere to secondary prevention measures.

Allam, Benha University, Benha, Egypt","Background: Bare metal stent (BMS) scaffolding of superficial femoral artery occlusive lesions has been associated with high rates of late clinical failure. Maintaining the patency of recanalized arterial segments was the main issue behind the concept of leave nothing behind to be evolved and percutaneous balloon angioplasty becomes the preferred option for endovascular therapy. Drug eluting balloons (DEBs) have shown to be an effective alternative to BMS for patients with de novo complex superficial femoral occlusive disease. Aims: To compare the outcome of DEB versus BMS in treating complex chronic total occlusion (CTO) of superficial femoral and proximal popliteal artery in patients with disabling claudication and critical limb ischemia regarding technical success, primary patency, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (cd-TLR), and limb salvage rate. Methods and Material: 90 patients (110 limbs) were complaining of disabling and critical limb ischemia due to complex femoro-popliteal occlusive lesions were randomly allocated into two groups according to the intervention method performed. Group (A); 48 patients (57 limbs) were submitted for treatment with paclitaxel DEBs and Group (B); 42 patients (53 limbs) submitted for treatment with BMS. Followup period was for 1, 6 and 12. Results: The Bare Metal Stents seem to have lower patency and higher cd-TLR rates compared to patients who received Paclitaxel Drug Coated Balloons but not statistically significant. The primary patency rates were 100%, 96%, 86.2%at 1, 6, 12 months respectively in DEB group, Vs 100%, 89.8%, 77.6% at 1, 6, 12 months respectively in BMS group. Clinically driven TLR rates were 2%, 7.8% at 6, 12 months respectively in DEB group Vs 6.1%, 14.2% at 6, 12 months respectively in BMS group. Conclusions: Percutaneous therapy for TASC C and D femoro-popliteal lesion using DEB or BMS are both safe and effective with one-year high patency rate. Paclitaxel Drug Elluting Balloons seem to have a promising important role in prevention of restenosis and recurrence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. However, stents are still playing important bailout role in the treatment of residual stenosis and dissection. Further follow-up is essential to obtain and document long-term outcome of different percutaneous therapy for complex and long SFA lesions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""REVIEW""]}",,paclitaxel;adult;artery occlusion;bare metal stent;chronic total occlusion;claudication;complication;conference abstract;controlled study;critical limb ischemia;drug therapy;drug-coated balloon;follow up;human;limb salvage;major clinical study;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;peripheral arterial disease;peripheral vascular disease;popliteal artery;prevention;randomized controlled trial;recurrent disease;restenosis;subsartorial artery;target lesion revascularization;therapy;treatment failure,,,Excluded,The study compares DCB vs BMS instead of DCB vs POBA as required.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

Although its use seemed initially promising, a recent publication has shown an increased risk of mortality with paclitaxel-coated devices, and there is an urgent need to reaffirm assessments of drug-eluting stents (DES). Objective: The aim of the study was to compare mortality and effectiveness of paclitaxel-coated stents and bare-metal stents (BMS) in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with long-term follow-up. Materials and methods: In a single center randomized study, 256 patients with PAD were treated intravascularly with stent implantation. Patients were randomized into two groups: the first (n = 126) were treated with DES, and the second (n = 130) were treated with BMS. The study included evaluation after the procedure, after about 6 months and 36 months. Co-morbidities, with risks for atherosclerosis, were analyzed in all patients. Patients were evaluated for clinical outcome, restenosis frequency, and safety (complications and total mortality). Results: Clinical benefit at the end of the investigation was statistically significantly better in the DES group compared with the BMS group: 85.7% versus 66.2% (p = 0.0003), respectively. Restenosis occurred significantly less frequently in patients with DES: 16.0% versus BMS: 35.0%, p = 0.012. There was no significant effect of comorbidities on the frequency of restenoses. There were no differences in all-cause mortality over the three years with paclitaxel and no-paclitaxel stents cohorts (8.7% versus 7.1%; long-rank p = 0.575). No association was found with mortality and treatment with DES or BMS.

Björkman, Vascular Surgery, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland","Introduction - Stenosis and restenosis are known complications of endovascular treatment of native arteries and bypass vein grafts in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). (1,2) This may lead to loss of the bypass graft, which can be a problem due to the limited availability of autologous vein material. Drug-coated balloons seem to be effective in the treatment of native artery stenosis (3). The biomechanical and anatomical properties of vein grafts differ greatly from native arteries, and less is known about the potential of drug-coated devices in this field. One randomized trial did not demonstrate benefit from use of DCBs over BA in bypass vein grafts. (4) Similar results were observed in a retrospective study comparing BA to DCB in peripheral grafts (5). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of drug-coated balloons in the treatment of vein graft stenoses. Design: Single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Block randomized by sealed envelope 1:1. Methods - 60 patients treated for primary or recurrent stenosis in venous bypass grafts were randomized to drug-coated balloon (DCB) (n=30) or standard balloon angioplasty (BA) (n=30). Follow-up was 1 year. Primary outcome measures were target lesion revascularization (TLR) and graft occlusion. Primary assisted patency and secondary patency were also assessed. Results - 57 cases were ultimately included in the study. 3 randomized cases were excluded due to primary technical failure (graft rupture during predilatation and bail-out stenting (N=2), aborted procedure (N=1)). Six patients died during follow-up (DCB 4, BA 2) and one patient underwent major amputation (BA group). 23 patients underwent re-revascularization of the same segment (DCB 10/29, 34.5 % vs. BA 13/28, 46.4 %, p=0.333). The overall TLR-rate at one year was 34.5 % and 46.4 % in the DCB and BA groups respectively (p=0.33). 5/57 (8.8 %) grafts occluded during the follow-up, 1/29 (3.4 %) and 4/28 (14.3 %) in the DCB and BA groups respectively (p=0.36). Secondary patency was 100 % in the DCB group compared to 89.3% in the BA group (p=0.076). In subanalysis including only de novo lesions TLR was significantly lower in grafts that were treated with DCB compared to BA (15 % vs. 18.9 %, P=0.03). Conclusion - There is a trend toward benefit from DCBs in the treatment of graft stenosis; this difference is significant in previously untreated lesions. There has been hesitation towards using drug-coated balloons as a first choice in the treatment of graft stenosis. Our results suggest that this hesitation might be unfounded, especially in de novo lesions. More data is needed to accurately select which lesions will benefit from DCBs.

Nordanstig, Department of vascular surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden","Introduction - Drug-eluting balloons and stents may improve outcomes after endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but current evidence for clinical efficiency and cost-effectiveness is limited. Published randomized trials have been underpowered to address patient-centered clinical endpoints. Instead, available evidence largely relies on device-specific industry-sponsored trials exploring surrogate endpoints. The SWEDEPAD trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of drug-elution technology versus conventional endovascular techniques in PAD, using patient-centered endpoints in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial design incorporated within the National Registry for Vascular Surgery (Swedvasc). Methods - The Swedvasc PAD module was supplemented with online randomization functionality and a trial database were integrated for trial purposes. All centers performing PAD interventions in Sweden were invited. Liberal inclusion criteria and few exclusion criteria enable recruitment of the majority of patients eligible for infrainguinal endovascular revascularization. The trial consists of two parallel studies, SWEDEPAD-1 (critical limb ischemia) and SWEDEPAD-2 (intermittent claudication) and although each trial will be evaluated separately, study procedures are similar. When a guide-wire is established across the obstructing lesion, patients are randomized between using or not using drug-eluting technology. Randomization is stratified for treated vascular segment and initial treatment strategy (PTA or primary stenting). All devices with a PAD CE-mark are allowed. Sample size is determined at 2400 in SWEDEPAD-1 and 1300 in SWEDEPAD-2 trial. An independent data and safety monitoring board regularly evaluates overall event rates. Patients are followed at one month and one year according to the Swedvasc routines, and other national registries are used to capture additional endpoints and long-term follow-up data. The primary endpoint for SWEDEPAD-1 is amputation rate, and the primary endpoint for SWEDEPAD-2 is health-related quality of life, assessed with VascuQol-6. Secondary endpoints include patency, target lesion revascularization and a health-economic assessment. Results - Trial inclusion started in late 2014. Until March 2018, in total 1824 patients were randomized, of which 1181 in SWEDEPAD 1 and 643 in SWEDEPAD 2. Participating centers has gradually increased and currently 22 of the 28 Swedish centers performing PAD interventions participate. Approximately 60 patients are currently randomized per month. In SWEDEPAD 1, 57% of interventions are performed in the femoropopliteal segment, 23% in the infrapopliteal segment and 20% in both segments combined. Of the femoropopliteal interventions, 29 % are primarily stented. In the SWEDEPAD 2 trial, the majority (91 %) is treated in the femoropopliteal segment and of these, 40 % are primarily stented. Conclusion - The SWEDEPAD trial is now halfway through the inclusion phase. No results are yet available. This trial explores the overall efficacy of drug-eluting technology in infrainguinal PAD interventions. The pragmatic clinical trial design, using a population-based registry with randomization functionality is a new and powerful tool for clinical vascular research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""no results available""]}",10.1016/j.ejvs.2019.06.995     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15322165&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ejvs.2019.06.995&atitle=The+Swedish+Drug-elution+Trials+in+Peripheral+Arterial+Disease+%28Swedepad%29+%E2%80%93+An+Update+Halfway+Through+the+Overall+Inclusion+Phase&stitle=Eur.+J.+Vasc.+Endovasc.+Surg.&title=European+Journal+of+Vascular+and+Endovascular+Surgery&volume=58&issue=6&spage=e367&epage=e368&aulast=Nordanstig&aufirst=Joakim&auinit=J.&aufull=Nordanstig+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=e367-e368&date=2019&auinit1=J&auinitm=,adult;amputation;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;cost effectiveness analysis;critical limb ischemia;drug-coated balloon;elution;endovascular surgery;female;follow up;guide wire;human;intermittent claudication;major clinical study;male;pragmatic trial;quality of life;randomization;randomized controlled trial;sample size;stent;surgery;Sweden;target lesion revascularization,,,Excluded,The study compares drug-eluting technology (including stents) vs conventional methods and includes non-femoropopliteal lesions.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

Methods: Patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were prospectively randomized to novel carrier-free ZENFlow (Zhejiang Zylox Medical Device Co Ltd, Hangzhou, China) paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (DCB) group or plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) group. The primary end point was late lumen loss at 6 months assessed by blinded angiographic core laboratory quantitative analyses. Secondary end points included primary target vessel patency at 12 months, binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization, target vessel revascularization, Rutherford class change, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) at 6 months. Results: There were 192 Chinese patients who were randomized in 15 hospitals (93 to DCB and 99 to PBA). The mean age of patients was 68 years; 71.9% were male, and 50.5% were smokers. No significant differences were identified between the groups in terms of baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, Rutherford class, and ABI. Mean lesion length was 62.5 mm; 12.7% had in-stent restenosis, and 37% of lesions were total occlusion. In total, 23 (12%) patients underwent bailout stenting because of flow-limiting dissection after balloon angioplasty. After 6 months, late lumen loss in the DCB and PBA groups was 0.80 ± 0.71 mm and 1.69 ± 0.87 mm (P <.0001), respectively. Primary target vessel patency rate was significantly higher in the DCB group than in the PBA group (54% vs 31.3%; P =.0091) at 12 months. Target vessel restenosis rate was dramatically lower in the DCB group than in the PBA group (16.3% vs 54.6%; P <.0001), as were target lesion revascularization (8.8% vs 27.1%; P =.052) and target vessel revascularization (11.8% vs 30%; P =.0086) at 6 months. Significant improvement in Rutherford class was found in the DCB group compared with the PBA group (P =.0385). Postoperative ABI was markedly increased in the DCB group than in the PBA group (0.89 ± 0.27 vs 0.78 ± 0.28; P =.0182) after 6 months. There were no definitely device-related deaths or major adverse events in either group.

Methods: In this first-in-man prospective, controlled, and randomized trial, patients with femoropopliteal symptomatic (Rutherford 2B-4) occlusive arterial disease were randomized 1:1 to either plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) or PBA followed by microcrystalline PCB (mcPCB; Balton Sp. z o.o., Warsaw, Poland) inflation. Late lumen loss was the primary end point of the study. Serious adverse events (SAEs) including death, amputation, and repeated revascularization were considered secondary end points. Routine angiography was scheduled at 6 months and ambulatory follow-up at 12 in all patients. Current follow-up time and ambulatory control is 3 years. Results: In total, 66 patients were included: 33 randomized to mcPCB and 33 to PBA. Mean lesion length was 58 ± 49 mm vs 63 ± 45 mm, most classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) B (50.0% vs 54.3%) and C category (29.4% vs 20.0%). At 6 months, the late lumen loss was lower by 62% (0.52 ± 1.3 mm vs 1.39 ± 1.1 mm) in the mcPCB group compared with PBA (Psup <.01). Binary restenosis occurred in 23% vs 52% patients subsequently (P =.02). The ankle-brachial index was significantly higher in patients in the studied group (0.97 ± 0.3 vs 0.83 ± 0.1; P =.01). At 1 year, the incidence of SAEs was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (25.0% vs 58.0%; P <.01) driven by twofold reduction of target vessel revascularization (25.0% vs 52.2%; P =.02) in the mcPCB group. In 3 years of follow-up, the mortality rate and incidence of SAEs were higher in the PBA group (P <.05). Conclusions: In this pivotal trial, mcPCB was superior to PBA in terms of restenosis inhibition and reduction of recurrent revascularizations in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease.

The incidence of FP In-stent restenosis (ISR) is best estimated at 50% at 24 months. Drug coated balloon (DCB) has been shown to be associated with improved outcomes compared with balloon angioplasty (BA). Previous studies have shown that laser atherectomy (LA) combined with DCB has superior 1-year outcomes compared to BA + LA. No prior studies have looked at the 2-year outcomes. Methods: This was a dual-center retrospective cohort study that compared patients with FP-ISR treated with DCB + LA versus LA + BA. A Cox regression analysis was used to examine 2-year outcomes, including target lesion revascularization (TLR) and the composite outcome of TLR or restenosis. Multivariable analysis was performed for clinical and statistically significant (in the univariate analysis) variables. Results: A total of 117 consecutive patients with Tosaka II (n = 32) and III (n = 85) were eligible. In total, 66 patients were treated with LA + DCB and 51 with LA + BA. The LA + DCB group had more lesions with moderate to severe degree of classification (58% vs. 13%; p < 0.0001). The LA + DCB group was more likely to be treated with the use of embolic protection devices (64% vs. 23%; p < 0.001) and cutting balloons (61% vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Bail-out stenting rates were lower in the LA + DCB group (32% vs. 57%; p = 0.008). LA + DCB was superior (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.9; p = 0.027) for the composite outcome of 2-year TLR or restenosis. The 12-month Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from TLR or restenosis were 66% in the LA + DCB group versus 46% in the LA + BA group. The 24-month KM estimates were 45% in the LA + DCB group versus 24% in the LA + BA group (Figure). [Figure presented] Conclusion: The combination of DCB + LA was associated with decreased rates of bail-out stenting and improved 2-year TLR or restenosis rates.

Rocha-Singh, Interventional Cardiology,Vascular and Endovascular Medicine, Prairie Heart Institute, St. John's Hospital, Springfield,, United States","Learning Objectives 1. To learn the different characteristics of calcium 2. To learn how to manage heavily calcified lesions 3. To compare the different devices available for calcium debulking Vascular calcification, regardless of the vascular bed, is a significant challenge that defines the limits of acute procedural and device-related success and limits clinical durability of interventional therapies. Our early experiences in endovascular approaches especially balloon angioplasty, in heavily calcified internal carotid arteries, renal arteries and calcified aortoiliac and infrainguinal atherosclerotic lesions have borne this out. Importantly, vascular calcification is a general marker for global atherosclerotic burden and, in some studies, a marker of increased cardiovascular related mortality. Calcium has been, is, and will continue to be a major challenge in cardiovascular percutaneous interventions. There is a growing understanding of the multiple pathways by which vascular calcification occurs. These pathways are complex, interrelated and involve endocrine, inflammatory, hormonal and metabolic pathways. As such, vascular calcification is a very biologically active disease process and does not represent “dead tissue” as is commonly perceived. Evolving technologies and therapies have targeted metabolic pathways that lead to vascular calcification and future therapies will help address and potentially prevent the progression to severe grades of calcification. At present, there are multiple non-invasive and invasive modalities used for assessment of calcification in a variety of vascular beds. Coronary artery calcium scoring using CTA and its potential to predict future cardiovascular events is well established. In the periphery,CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive methods to assess the degree andextent of VC. However, both imaging modalities use contrast agents (iodinated for computed tomography and gadolinium-based for MR), which are associated with potential nephrotoxicity, and CT exposes patients to ionizing radiation CTA remains an important noninvasive imaging modality. Intravascular ultrasound is the best assessment for the degree and extent of VC. Unfortunately, this is not widely used, in part, because it is not uniformly reimbursed and its associated expense. As such, fluoroscopy remains the most practical and uniformly available modality for the assessment of femoropopliteal calcification. Despite this, fluoroscopy underestimates the extent and location of calcification in the femoropopliteal artery and particularly in tibial vessels. As such, these discrepant modalities add to our challenge in developing uniform scoring systems and assisting the physician in assessing the extent of vascular calcification, both pre- and post-intervention and its impact on both acute procedural success and clinical durability. Vascular Calcium Scoring Systems There are at least seven different calcium scoring systems published or disclosed as core lab scoring systems which have been used in investigational trials. Frequently cited calcium scales include the PARC and PACSS scales, and grading scales used by angiographic core labs in recently presented the IN.PACT Global SFA registry and the Philips ILLUMENATE trial. Additionally, Dr. Antonio Micari and investigators published a grading scale used in a multicenter, core lab adjudicated assessment of the IN.PACT™Admiral™DCB in long SFA lesions. These scales have many similarities: they primarily look at the circumferential nature of the calcification (i.e., present on both sides of the vessel wall as assessed by fluoroscopy) and the extent of the circumferential calcium as a function of total lesion length. Importantly, these grading scales remain hypothetical as none has been independently validated their potential impact on acute procedural success or 12-mo. maintenance of primary lesion patency. VIVA Calcium Index Score VIVA Physicians, in collaboration industry partners, sought to understand how vascular calcification impacts the acute procedural outcomes and impact on 12-month primary patency of DCBs. An independent angiographic core lab analyzed the varying degrees of femoropopliteal artery calcification assessed by standard fluoroscopy to determine its impact on loss of 12-month primary patency in a patient level deidentified data set of 1,185 lesions in 1,135 claudicants enrolled in DCB arms of the IN.PACT™SFA and Illuminate randomized controlled trials, the IN.PACT™SFA Global and Illuminate Global Studies, and the IN.PACT™Long Lesion sub-study. Respective angiographic core laboratories provided initial angiographic analyses for reference vessel diameter, % diameter stenoses and dissection grades for the IN.PACT™SFA and the Illuminate Trials. Angiograms from both studies were then reviewed at a Central Core Laboratory using a novel fluoroscopy-based vascular calcification scoring system by observers blinded to the clinical outcomes. 1,184 lesions were analyzed with co-registration of 12-month target lesion assessment of primary patency adjudicated by an independent duplexultrasound core lab. Primary patency failure was the primary endpoint of the analysis. Univariate predictors of primary patency failure were identified and a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed using candidate variables with univariate p-value <0.10. Lesion calcium burden was determined by a quantitative assessment of the length of calcium measured on both sides of the lesion and normalized to both lesion length and treatment length. The overall 12-month loss of primary patency was 23.0%. The multivariate analysis predictive of 12-month primary patency failure included the presence of exophytic calcium (OR 3.13; p<0.001), total calcium length (OR 1.004; p=0.028) and total bilateral calcium length normalized to treatment length (OR 1.01; p=0.013). This analysis of a large de-identified patient-level data set determined that the total calcium lesion length (unilateral + bilateral) and the total bilateral calcium length normalized to total treatment length, defined using standard fluoroscopy, were important predictors of 12-month loss of primary patency after DCB angioplasty. Calcium-Directed Technologies for Vessel Preparation The pursuit of these essential questions is drawn from the initial results of the DEFINITIVE AR trial. This small, randomized pilot trial combined vessel pre-treatment using directional atherectomy with post-atherectomy treatment with the Cotavance® drug-coated balloon. In a post-hoc analysis of a sub-cohort in this hypotheses-generating trial, a potential positive treatment effect in improving the 1-year primary patency was suggested when atherectomy and DCB were combined in long, calcified lesions compared to DCB alone. The REALITY study will build on this positive signal in a more robust and thorough evaluation of combining directional atherectomy vessel preparation with DCB and extend the evaluation of the potential treatment effect through 24 months. The REALITY study (diRectional atherEctomy + drug coAted balloon to treat long calcIfied femoropopLiteal arterY stenoses) is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm observational assessment of the safety and effectiveness of directional atherectomy debulking of long, severely calcified lesions prior to drug-coated balloon treatment in patients with life-style limiting claudication due to obstructive atherosclerotic femoropopliteal disease. The study utilized angiographic and duplex Doppler core labs to independently adjudicate primary patency and freedom of clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12-months. REALITY study recently completed enrollment of 101 patients at US and German sites and studied the combination of vessel preparation with the HawkOne™ or TurboHawk™ atherectomy systems prior to the use of the Medtronic IN.PACT™Admiral™drug-coated balloon. To date, REALITY is the most rigorous independently adjudicated study to evaluate the combined use of the two technologies to address severely calcified, long femoropopliteal lesions. In addition to assessing the effectiveness of the HawkOne™ and TurboHawk™ atherectomy debulking, the study will validate the procedural, 30-day and 12-month impact of severe vascular calcification using a unified calcium-scoring index. The use of adjunct technologies, including a variety of atherectomy devices, and emerging novel specialty balloons including the intravascular lithotripsy (IVL®) system (Shockwave Medical, Fremont, CA) using pulsatile sonic pressure waves to modify intimal and medial calcium, may be used in combination with drug coated balloons to address more complex vascular lesions and promote acute procedural success and long-term clinical durability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00270-019-02282-x     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=1432086X&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00270-019-02282-x&atitle=Calcium+solutions%3A+Which+calcium+needs+treatment+and+how%3F&stitle=Cardiovasc.+Intervent.+Radiol.&title=CardioVascular+and+Interventional+Radiology&volume=42&issue=3&spage=S67&epage=S68&aulast=Rocha-Singh&aufirst=K.&auinit=K.&aufull=Rocha-Singh+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S67-S68&date=2019&auinit1=K&auinitm=,calcium;contrast medium;endogenous compound;gadolinium;adult;anonymised data;artery occlusion;atherectomy device;atherosclerosis;blood vessel calcification;blood vessel diameter;blood vessel wall;claudication;clinical outcome;comparative effectiveness;computer assisted tomography;conference abstract;controlled study;core laboratory;coronary artery calcium score;directional atherectomy;dissection;drug combination;drug safety;drug-coated balloon;endocrine system;female;fluoroscopy;human;internal carotid artery;intravascular ultrasound;iodination;ionizing radiation;renal artery;learning;lifestyle;lithotripsy;major clinical study;male;mortality;multicenter study;nephrotoxicity;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;physician;post hoc analysis;prevention;quantitative analysis;randomized controlled trial;scoring system;surgery;target lesion revascularization;vascular lesion,,,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Excluded,Disagree

Holden, Radiology, Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand","Learning Objectives 1. To understand the limitations of current drug-eluting concepts 2. To understand the importance of vessel preparation 3. To know attempts how to potentially enhance effectiveness of current drug-eluting technologies In the era of drug delivery to reduce re-stenosis, vessel preparation has expanded to not only include an optimized angioplasty result (with minimal residual stenosis and flow-limiting dissection) but also improve drug delivery and retention in the vessel wall. By improving drug delivery to the deeper layers of the vessel wall theses layers, vessel preparation devices may enhance the anti-restenotic effect, possibly for longer periods and at lower doses. The most common vessel preparation devices include specialty balloons and atherectomy. Specialty balloons include cutting and scoring balloons as well as the Chocolate balloon. The drug-coated Chocolate drug-coated balloon (DCB) combines vessel preparation with drug delivery and has been successfully evaluated in the ENDURE Trial. The device is currently being evaluated in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. Atherectomy has been shown to enhance the effect of drug-elution. This was demonstrated in the DEFINITIVE AR study where long and calcified lesions showed a significantly better patency if pre-treated by directional atherectomy followed by DCB rather than DCB alone. The REALITY Trial provides updated data on this technique. An alternative approach in calcified arterial disease is intra-vascular lithotripsy (IVL) with Shockwave.™ This angioplasty balloon-based therapy has been shown in the DISRUPT PAD I&II Trials to effectively treat calcified femoro-popliteal stenoses with an excellent acute luminal gain and a very low incidence of stenting. However, re-stenosis was significant in this patient cohort and the DISRUPT PAD III Trial (comparing IVL followed by DCB to plain balloon angioplasty followed by DCB) is currently enrolling. An update of this important trial will be provided as well as lessons from the Observational Registry which includes a large “real world” cohort of patients. Several other dedicated vessel preparation devices will be discussed. These include the Cagent Serranator device, evaluated in the Prelude study. An interesting approach is a temporary spur stent technology from Reflow Medical which potentially provides successful angioplasty with a low incidence of late recoil and improved drug delivery. The device has the additional advantage of being agnostic to the choice of anti-restenotic drug. Finally, treating complex arterial disease, an incidence of residual stenosis and dissection requiring scaffolding is expected. An alternative to conventional stents is tacks from Intact Vascular. These devices provide a very focal scaffold, minimizing the amount of metal and maintaining normal vessel physiology. These have been extensively studies evaluated in the TOBA II trial and results will be presented.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design",10.1007/s00270-019-02282-x     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=1432086X&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00270-019-02282-x&atitle=Adjunctive+therapies+to+enhance+drug-eluting+efficacy&stitle=Cardiovasc.+Intervent.+Radiol.&title=CardioVascular+and+Interventional+Radiology&volume=42&issue=3&spage=S112&epage=&aulast=Holden&aufirst=A.&auinit=A.&aufull=Holden+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=S112-&date=2019&auinit1=A&auinitm=,endogenous compound;protein arginine deiminase;adult;Agnostic;artery disease;blood vessel wall;chocolate;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;directional atherectomy;dissection;drug delivery system;drug-coated balloon;elution;female;human;incidence;lithotripsy;low drug dose;male;multicenter study;osteophyte;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;prospective study;randomized controlled trial;restenosis;stent;surgery,,,Excluded,"The trial compares IVL + DCB vs POBA + DCB, not DCB vs POBA directly.

We now present the two-year clinical results and a cost-benefit analysis for Germany. (Figure presented) Patients and methods A total of 153 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAD) were randomized either to drug coated balloon (DCB, n = 78) or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA, n = 75). The two-year clinical results consisting of target lesion revascularization (TLR), patency and increase in walking distance were defined as secondary endpoints. A cost-benefit analysis for Germany was conducted based on the 2-year clinical results. Results Between 14 and 24 months there were no additional TLRs in both groups (DCB: 19.1 % vs. POBA 40.6 %, p = 0.007). The patency rate at 2 years was significantly higher in the DCB group (72.3 % vs. 48.4 %, p = 0.006). 2-year cost savings of 1,111.97 per patient were estimated in case DCBs were used instead of POBAs.

Methods Totally 54 patients with femoropopliteal arteriosclerosis obliterans who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) were randomly divided into test group and control group after successful predilation during operation. Patients in test group were treated with DCB, while those in control group were treated with uncoated balloon (UCB) during PTA. A 6-month follow-up was performed after operation. The treatment effect and safety between the two groups were compared. Additional analysis among patients who had a non-flow-limiting dissection during PTA in each group was done. Results Six months after PTA, there were 26 patients in test group and 20 patients in control group after getting rid of 8 patients lost to follow-up. The ankle brachial index (ABI) and minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of target lesion were higher (both P<0.05), and the Rutherford stage, degree of target lesion stenosis, late lumen lose (LLL), the rate of restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) were lower (all P<0.05) in test group than those in control group. There were 14 patients in test group (subgroup A) and 8 patients in control group (subgroup B) who had a non-flow-limiting dissection. Except for the ABI and Rutherford stage 6 months after PTA (both P>0.05), the other effect indexes were statistically different between the two subgroups (all P<0.05). The rates of major adverse events and amputation were similar between test group and control group (both P>0.05).

The aim of this study was to prove the superiority of a novel, microcrystalline and biodegradable polymer paclitaxel coated balloon (mcPCB, PAK, Balton, Poland) in restenosis inhibition for femoro-popliteal arterial disease when compared to plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). METHODS In this first-in-man, prospective, controlled randomized trial patients with symptomatic (Rutherford Class 2-5) femoro-popliteal, occlusive arterial disease (>50% diameter stenosis) were randomized to either PBA alone or mcPCB dilation after PBA in a 1 :1 fashion. Late lumen loss (LLL) was the primary endpoint of the study, whereas the composite endpoint of Serious Adverse Events (SAE, Death, Amputation, Repeated Revascularizaation) were considered secondary endpoints. Routine angiography was scheduled at 6 months and ambulatory follow-up at 12 months. RESULTS In total 66 patients were included in the study, 33 randomized to mcPCB and 33 to POBA. At 6 months The LLL was 0.52±1.3 vs. 1.39±1.1 mm in the mcPCB when compared to POBA, psup<0.01). Binary restenosis occurred in 23% vs. 52% patients subsequently (p=0.02). In doppler evaluation, ankle-brachial index was significantly higher in patients in the mcPCB group (0.97±0.3 vs. 0.83±0.1; p=0.01). At one year, the incidence of SAE was significantly lower in the mcPCB group (25.0 vs. 58.0% ; p<0.01), which was mainly driven by the reduction of repeated revascularizations in the mcPCB group (24.2 vs. 53.3%; p=0.02). CONCLUSION In this pivotal trial, novel, microcrystalline and biodegradable polymer PCB was safe and superior when compared to POBA in restenosis inhibition and reduction of recurrent revascularizations in patients with femoropopliteal PAD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""SOLO ABSTRACT""]}",10.1016/j.jacc.2017.09.741     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15583597&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jacc.2017.09.741&atitle=Prospective%2C+controlled%2C+clinical+randomized+trial+evaluating+novel%2C+microcrystalline+and+biodegradable+polymer+paclitaxel+coated+balloon+for+the+treatment+of+femoro-popliteal+disease+%28The+biopac+trial%29-one+year+outcome&stitle=J.+Am.+Coll.+Cardiol.&title=Journal+of+the+American+College+of+Cardiology&volume=70&issue=18&spage=B233&epage=&aulast=Buszman&aufirst=Piotr&auinit=P.&aufull=Buszman+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=B233-&date=2017&auinit1=P&auinitm=,polymer;adult;adverse event;amputation;angiography;ankle brachial index;controlled study;death;follow up;graft occlusion;human;incidence;major clinical study;male;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;peripheral arterial disease;Poland;prospective study;randomized controlled trial;restenosis;revascularization,,,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Included,Disagree

The incidence of restenosis can be reduced by the use of drug-coated balloons. However, dose, coating composition, and technology are decisive for efficacy. Methods: The study prospectively randomized 200 Chinese patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease to treatment with new paclitaxel-coated or standard uncoated balloon catheters. The primary end point was angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at ± months measured by a blinded core laboratory. Secondary angiographic end points (6 months) and specific clinical end points (1 year) were binary restenosis, ankle-brachial index, Rutherford stage, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), and amputation. Results: The patient population was 74% male, 66 years old, 31% smokers, and 55% diabetic. They were at Rutherford stage 2 to 5, lesion length was 150 mm, 25% in-stent restenosis, 55% occlusion or partial occlusion, and 20% provisional stenting. LLL at ± months was available for 89%, clinical follow-up for >95% per group. LLL was 0.05 ± 0.73 mm for coated balloons and 1.15 ± 0.89 mm for uncoated balloons (P <.001); correspondingly, restenosis rate was 22.5% vs 70.8% (P <.001). After 1 year, the TLR rate was 7.2% vs 39.6% (P <.001). Rutherford class and ankle-brachial index improved more markedly in the coated group (P <.046 and.023, respectively). One major amputation was recorded in the control group. No coating-related adverse events were observed for doses of up to 43 mg paclitaxel/patient. After 24 months, primary patency was 64.6% vs 31.4% and the TLR rate was 13.5% vs 41.1%. There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of death and major amputation.

The IN.PACT Global Study's imaging cohort consists of three sub-groups, each with at least 150 patients: de novo in-stent restenosis; long lesions (at least 15 cm); and chronic total occlusions (at least 5 cm). Patients and Methods: The 157 patients from the IN.PACT Global Study's long lesion imaging cohort had a total of 164 lesions of at least 15 cm in length. All patients in the imaging cohort were required to undergo duplex ultrasound at 12-months post-procedure and at the time of a reintervention (if one occurred) to assess for patency. Results: The average lesion length in this subset was 26.4 ± 8.61 cm, 71.8% had calcified lesions, 60.4% had total occlusions and 41.0% had diabetes. At 360 days, clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) rate was 6.0% and primary patency rate was 91.1% according to Kaplan Meier analysis. There was a 94.0% freedom from major adverse safety events and no major target limb amputations through 12-month follow-up. No difference was found between the plain DCB cohort and the ones who received provisional stent implantation.

Superior primary patency and non-inferior safety of Lutonix® DCB was recently demonstrated in the prospective, global multicenter randomized Levant 2 pivotal trial. Results for the cohort enrolled in Germany are here reported. Material und Methoden:Patients with Rutherford class 2-4 femoropopliteal artery lesions were randomized 2:1 at 8 sites in Germany between August 2011 and July 2012 to treatment with Lutonix DCB (n=83) vs. uncoated control (n=43). The primary efficacy endpoint was primary patency at 12 months, and the primary safety endpoint was composite freedom at 12 months from perioperative death, index-limb related death, amputation (below or above the ankle), and index-limb revascularization. Secondary outcomes included target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse events and functional outcomes. Ergebnisse: Demographic, medical, and lesion characteristics were matched between Lutonix DCB and PTA groups. Average lesion length was 58mm and average treated length 100mm. Severe calcification was present in 11% of lesions, and 23% were total occlusions. Final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedural success (91%) were also similar Lutonix DCB and PTA groups. By Kaplan-Meier analysis at 12 months, the primary patency rate was 80% vs. 58%, p = 0.015 and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs. 72%, p = 0.001. Freedom-from-TLR was higher for DCB (96%) compared to uncoated PTA (82%, p = 0.012). Other major adverse events were similar for both groups. The observed benefit favoring DCB over PTA was observed in both German males and females. Diskussion: Superiority of DCB over PTA in the German cohort of Levant 2 was demonstrated for the endpoints of primary patency, composite safety, and freedom from TLR. The benefit of DCB was also consistent between females and males.

Sharma, Dept of Cardiac Radiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India","Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the latest trial results 2. To learn which patients benefit most from drug-eluting devices 3. To learn about adjunctive medical therapy The management of advanced obstructive infrapopliteal disease poses challenges due to unfavorable image morphology characterized by diffused, multifocal, and multi-segment occlusive lesions with poor or absent distal run-off vessels. Below-the-knee (BTK) disease is not the same as above knee disease and often presents with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Patients frequently have comorbidities, such as diabetes and renal failure. Both intima and media are diseased with an involvement of smaller arteries. The disease frequently involves long segments, has heavily calcified arteries, and additional proximal femoropopliteal disease. There are no TASC guidelines for BTK lesions. Leg ulcers may have multifactorial etiologies, including neuropathy, infection, venous insufficiency, and arterial insufficiency. These patients require a multispecialty higher level of care. Further, minor amputations are not regarded as treatment failure. Many a times, vascular interventions are performed to lower the level of amputation. The occurrence of restenosis is difficult to evaluate due to a variety of issues, including lack of uniform angiographic follow-up, heavy calcification precluding optimal duplex ultrasound and CT angiography, low eGFR if present precluding MR angiography, and inability to perform anklebrachial pressure index due to the presence of ulcers or its unreliability due to diffuse occlusive disease. Long-term patency rates also do not have a linear relationship with clinical outcomes. Wound or ulcer healing relate better to the outcome, and limb salvage rates are better than patency rates for predicting the outcome of endovascular revascularization. Short-term patency, resulting in pulsatile blood flow to ischemic ulcers, promotes repair mechanisms and tissue salvage. Treatment strategies include medical management, wound care, and endovascular and surgical revascularization. Endovascular procedures include balloon angioplasty [including drug-eluting balloons (DEB)], stenting [bare-metal stent (BMS) and with coatings such as carbon and pharmacologic agents (DES)], and therapeutic angiogenesis. In suitable patients with severe limb ischemia with a life expectancy of >2 years and a usable vein, bypass surgery was advocated (BASIL trail) for infrainguinal lesions1. Bypass had better patency rates than endovascular techniques but with no significant difference in limb salvage rate. In patients with <2-year life expectancy, balloon angioplasty (PTA) may be an alternative as it is associated with less morbidity and cost, and such patients are unlikely to enjoy the long-term benefits of surgery. No clear guidelines are available for the treatment of isolated BTK disease. PTA of tibial arteries in patients with CLI had 1-year primary patency rate between 33%- 37%, a secondary patency rate of 56%-63%, and a limb salvage rate of 75%-100%2,3. Early infrapopliteal stent trials results were not better than PTA in terms of patency rates and were limited by many issues, including small numbers, usage of stents not designed for this anatomic location, short follow-up durations, and limited structured studies. There is a paucity of well-designed prospective randomized studies comparing these two techniques. No definite benefits in terms of patency or limb salvage were seen in published studies. Stents have been traditionally used as a bail-out therapy subsequent to suboptimal angioplasty. There is experimental evidence to suggest that BMS with passive coating, amorphous silicon carbide coating, and magnesium alloys reduce the thrombogenicity of the device. InPeria 11 trial4 evaluated PTA versus carbon-coated stents in infrapopliteal disease and showed some benefit at 3-month follow-up for the stent group. However, there was no effect on the amputation rate at 3 and 9 months. Moreover, nitinol stents for infrapopliteal disease have shown some promising results. XCELL trial5 data demonstrated that primary infrapopliteal nitinol stenting to treat CLI is safe and effective in improving 6- and 12-month outcomes. There is growing evidence that DEB and DES can improve the outcomes of BTK endovascular recanalization. These have the potential to shorten the duration and quantity of antiplatelet drugs and may result in higher drug tissue bioavailability due to higher drug surface area in these anatomical locations. DEB has the advantage that there is no foreign material, and drug delivery is homogenous and immediate. These also do not predispose to chronic inflammation and thrombosis and hence, have the potential for lower restenosis6. DEBATE-BTK is a randomized, open-label, single-center study comparing drug-eluting balloons and PTA7. Patients with diabetes, CLI, significant stenosis or occlusion of >40 mm of at least 1 BTK vessel with distal runoff, and with >1-year life expectancy were included. Binary in-segment restenosis at a 1-year angiographic or ultrasonographic follow-up was the primary endpoint. Clinically driven target lesion revascularization, major amputation, and target vessel occlusion were included as secondary endpoints. In all, 132 patients with 158 infrapopliteal lesions were enrolled. The mean length of treated segments was 129 ± 83 mm in the DEB group compared with 131 ± 79 mm in the PTA group (P = 0.7). Binary restenosis, assessed by angiography in >90% patients, occurred in 20/74 lesions (27%) in the DEB group compared with 55/74 lesions (74%) in the PTA group (P < 0.001); target lesion revascularization was observed in 12 patients (18%) versus 29 (43%; P = 0.002) lesions and target vessel occlusion in 12 (17%) versus 41 (55%; P < 0.001). Only 1 major amputation occurred in the PTA group (P = 0.9). DEB compared with PTA significantly reduced 1-year restenosis rates and improved target lesion revascularization with lower target vessel occlusion in treatment of BTK lesions in diabetic patients with CLI. Further, IN.PACT DEEP trial is a 2:1 randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of infrapopliteal arterial revascularization between IN.PACT Amphirion paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (IA-DEB) and standard balloon angioplasty (PTA) in patients with CLI. Altogether, 358 patients at 13 European centers were enrolled. It will assess the overall impact on infrapopliteal artery patency, limb salvage, wound healing, pain control, quality of life, and patient mobility; 1-year results should be shortly available. Moreover, the use of DES has shown good results. The proven efficacy of DES in the treatment of coronary artery disease gave rise to the notion that they may have a better patency compared with BMS in small infrapopliteal vessels. YUKON BTX trial8 was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind trial comparing sirolimuseluting stents (SES) with BMS for the treatment of focal infrapopliteal lesions. One hundred and sixty one patients with a mean target lesion length of 31 ± 9 mm were treated. Eighty two patients were randomized to the SES group and 79 to the BMS group; 76.5% patients in the SES group and 79.7% in the BMS group reached 1-year follow-up. The 1-year primary patency rate was 80.6% versus 55.6%. The secondary 1-year patency was 91.9% versus 71.4%. There was no statistically significant difference in limb salvage rate or mortality. SES achieved significantly higher primary and secondary patency rates as compared with BMS for focal infrapopliteal arterial lesions. Follow-up at 2 years showed that long-term eventfree survival, amputation rates, and clinical status were significantly improved by DES compared with BMS. DESTINY trial, another multicenter, randomized controlled study, suggested that the treatment of infrapopliteal lesions with everolimus-eluting stents reduced restenosis and the need for reintervention compared with BMS. ACHILLES trial is a multicenter European RCT comparing the role of sirolimus-eluting stent versus PTA in 200 patients with intermittent claudication or CLI. It showed the superiority of DES over PTA in terms of clinical endpoint at 1-year follow up. There is level 1 evidence for the use of olimus-eluting stents for short/focal infrapopliteal lesions and improved patency of DES versus BMS or PTA for short/focal lesions9,10. Infrapopliteal DES inhibits restenosis, reduces repeat procedures and improves event-free survival. Gene and stem cell therapy may emerge as a new frontier in the treatment of infrapopliteal disease in no-option CLI patients. Therapeutic angiogenesis aims to treat ischemic tissues by delivering recombinant proteins, genes, or cells to promote neoangiogenesis11. Despite the fact that preclinical studies showed promising results for both these forms of treatment, there have been concerns regarding the safety, side effects, protein efficacy, and gene transfer studies12. These have led to the development of cell-based therapies as alternative approaches to induce vascular regeneration and to improve the function of damaged tissue. Therapeutic angiogenesis using stem cells has the potential to rewrite treatment algorithms in suitable patients. Stem cells from embryonic tissue have pluripotent potential and may provide potent clinical outcomes but have serious ethical issues and potential danger of differentiation into unfavorable cell types. Hence, most clinical experience is based on the use of adult stem cells usually derived from bone marrow peripheral blood and adipose tissue. Most trials have shown varying degrees of benefit in terms of relief of symptoms, improvement in indices such as ankle brachial pressure index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements, and collateral number and density among others.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",,nitinol;carbon;runoff;antithrombocytic agent;alloy;silicon carbide;magnesium;everolimus;sirolimus;paclitaxel;recombinant protein;protein;Europe;society;human;patient;stent;follow up;amputation;limb salvage;revascularization;restenosis;tissues;occlusion;angiogenesis;life expectancy;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;artery;randomized controlled trial;therapy;safety;diabetes mellitus;stem cell;devices;ulcer;gene;knee disease;endovascular surgery;disease management;calcification;blood flow;intima;drug delivery system;foreign body;thrombosis;stenosis;angiography;wound care;bioavailability;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon;recanalization;morphology;treatment failure;thrombogenicity;pressure measurement;oxygen tension;kidney failure;tibial artery;ulcer healing;morbidity;wound;arterial insufficiency;basil;gene transfer;cardiac resynchronization therapy device;algorithm;surgery;bone marrow;angioplasty;adipose tissue;bypass surgery;density;learning;magnetic resonance angiography;vein bypass;event free survival;chronic inflammation;vein insufficiency;infection;diabetic patient;neuropathy;limb ischemia;computed tomographic angiography;artery lesion;mortality;etiology;coronary artery disease;quality of life;bare metal stent;pain;wound healing;patient mobility;double blind procedure;survival;vascular patency;intermittent claudication;repeat procedure;stem cell transplantation;side effect;cell therapy;regeneration;embryo tissue;cells by body anatomy;adult stem cell;blood;ankle brachial index;ultrasound;leg ulcer;critical limb ischemia;drug eluting stent,,,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Excluded,Disagree

Methods: One hundred-one patients were prospectively randomized in a single-blind multicenter study to compare the safety and efficacy of a paclitaxel plus excipient coated balloon catheter (sponsor Lutonix, Minnesota USA, NCT#00930813) versus an uncoated balloon catheter. Patients were stratified prior to randomization into stent or non-stent groups. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months post treatment. Results: Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. Mean lesion length of the lesion by visual estimate of the Investigator was 8.7±3.7 cm. Conclusions: Thirty day safety data was equal between the test and control groups. Six month angiographic and clinical data will be presented.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study duration | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""STUDY PROTOCOL, NO RESULTS""]}",10.1016/j.jacc.2010.08.005     LK  - https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/openurl/41SLSP_UZB/41SLSP_UZB:UZB?sid=Elsevier:EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=07351097&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.jacc.2010.08.005&atitle=A+prospective%2C+multicenter%2C+single+blind%2C+randomized%2C+controlled+trial+comparing+the+Lutonix+catheter+vs.+Standard+balloon+angioplasty+for+treatment+of+femoropopliteal+arteries+with+and+without+stenting+%28LEVANT+I%29&stitle=J.+Am.+Coll.+Cardiol.&title=Journal+of+the+American+College+of+Cardiology&volume=56&issue=13&spage=xv&epage=&aulast=Scheinert&aufirst=Dierk&auinit=D.&aufull=Scheinert+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=xv-&date=2010&auinit1=D&auinitm=,paclitaxel;excipient;stent;artery;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty;randomized controlled trial;therapy;catheter;balloon catheter;safety;patient;randomization;control group;clinical study;artery disease;restenosis;multicenter study;United States,,,Included,"Meets all inclusion criteria: RCT design, explicit DCB vs POBA comparison, and strictly femoropopliteal population.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

Symptoms of PAD range from ischemic rest pain and/or ischemic ulcers/gangrene (critical limb ischemia), putting the extremity at risk of amputation, to exercise‐induced pain (intermittent claudication), limiting the patients daily activities. Invasive treatments are often indicated to prevent amputations and to alleviate symptoms. More than two thirds of these procedures are presently performed with endovascular techniques (i.e. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, PTA with or without stent implantation). In coronary artery disease, stents eluting anti‐proliferative drugs (drug eluting stents, DES) reduce restenosis and improve clinical results for the majority of patients. Drug eluting balloons (DEB) are a promising alternative, but there is still little evidence that DES or DEB technology improve clinical outcome in PAD. However, promising results utilizing these new technologies in PAD have been reported in a few studies. In this trial, we test the hypothesis that drug eluting (DE) technology is superior to conventional endovascular treatment (no‐DE) in terms of important clinical outcomes, when applied on infrainguinal (femoropopliteal and/or infrapopliteal) obstructive vascular lesions.

A minority of symptomatic PAD patientswould present with infra‐popliteal (distal or below‐the‐knee) lesions: in these patients,the endovascular treatment is challenging.Drug‐coated balloons (DCB) and drug‐eluting stents (DES) were developed to preventneo‐intimal proliferation and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA), an objective which had been achieved by the local application of either cytostatic(e.g. paclitaxel ‐ a cytoskeletal disruptor) or immunosuppressive (e.g.sirolimus/everolimus ‐ both mTOR inhibitors) substances on the vessel wall.Over the past decade, a few randomized controlled trials (RCT) compared the efficacy andsafety of drug‐coated (mainly paclitaxel‐coated) devices vs. that of uncoated ones, anddemonstrated a significant reduction in restenosis rates, late lumen loss, and incidenceof target lesion re‐vascularization. However, the size of these trials was often toosmall to draw firm conclusions concerning major clinical outcomes. Moreover, substantialheterogeneity of the study populations and too restrictive eligibility criteria limitedtheir external validity, leading to a difficult interpretation of the results of latermeta‐analyses. Indeed, these trials adopted as the primary outcome surrogate (and rathersubjective) outcomes, such as vessel patency and target limb re‐vascularization, whichmay be difficult to objectively adjudicate in the setting of an open‐label trial, ratherthan ´hard´ objective clinical endpoints, such as major amputation or urgentrevascularization due to critical limb ischemia.Moreover, despite the short‐term effects appeared promising based on imaging outcome,tthe results of a recent meta‐analysis of 28 trials showed an increased two‐yearmortality in the group of patients treated with paclitaxel‐coated balloons. Based onthese results, and after analysis of follow‐up data from the trials that led to theapproval of these products, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel concluded that,despite the short‐term benefits with paclitaxel‐based devices, safety concerns may existfor mid‐term mortality risk.Alternative drug candidates to paclitaxel‐coated balloon catheters are the so‐calledlimus‐based analogs, which own cytostatic properties and are characterized by a widertherapeutic window. Recently, a novel balloon catheter has been CE‐certified: itencapsulates sirolimus in phospholipid drug nanocarriers to improve adhesion propertiesof sirolimus and to provide better bioavailability.

This disorder is typically caused by atherosclerosis that limits blood flow to the limbs, particularly due to stenosis or occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or popliteal artery. Although many patients are asymptomatic or are treated with lifestyle changes, such as exercise therapy, or pharmacological treatment, including statins and anti‐platelet therapy, about 10‐15% of patients have progressive symptoms which in severe cases may lead to amputation. Endovascular treatment with percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI), which includes percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), stenting, atherectomy and thrombolytic therapy, can provide excellent acute success rates greater than 90‐95% However, the intermediate to long‐term patency rates of these arteries is hampered by neointimal hyperplasia resulting in restenosis of the artery. This occurs with all endovascular therapy to some degree in both the coronary and peripheral arena. With PVI in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries the restenosis rates are approximately 30‐40% at 12 months, depending on the complexity and severity of the disease. In the coronary field, stents are now coated with anti‐restenotic pharmacologic agents (drug eluting stents—DES) such as paclitaxel and sirolimus‐like drugs that prevent neointimal growth. There have been published reports of significant efficacy in preventing restenosis in the SFA by coating balloons with paclitaxel (drug eluting balloons—DEB) as well as a nitinol stent. Despite the fact that these products are CE Mark approved and available in Europe, currently there are no US FDA approved drug‐eluting devices for use in PVI. Thus, there remains a need for an alternative therapy to prevent restenosis in the SFA following endovascular intervention. Administration of intra‐arterial paclitaxel mixed with iodinated contrast has been shown to inhibit restenosis in a porcine coronary model. Delivering paclitaxel intra‐arterially in the coronary tree following stent implantation has shown benefit in reducing the incidence of restenosis. The novel Targeted Adjustable Pharmaceutical Application System (TAPAS)—TAPAS Catheter Therapeutic Infusion System (ThermopeutiX, San Diego, CA, USA)—is a drug delivery catheter that consists of a proximal and distal occlusion balloon with an adjustable length that allows a drug to dwell in a specific segment of the artery for a period of time. The drug can then be aspirated and discarded to avoid systemic exposure. The PacTAP study is a randomized, double blind, placebo‐control study to assess the safety and efficacy of delivering intra‐arterial paclitaxel via the TAPAS catheter following PVI to prevent restenosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""}",,Albumin‐Bound Paclitaxel;Paclitaxel;Peripheral Arterial Disease;Peripheral Vascular Diseases,,,Excluded,"Study compares intra-arterial paclitaxel via TAPAS catheter (not DCB) vs placebo after PVI, not DCB vs POBA.

Participants: Patients with critical limb ischaemia who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Participation is entirely voluntary and eligible subjects should be competent to understand the implications of participation in the study. Informed consent forms are designed to assure the protection of patient's rights. Before enrolment all patients will have to give their written informed consent. The centre's local investigator ensures that the patient will be informed on the basis of the Informed Consent Form. 3. Outcome Measurement (3.1) Primary outcome: Primary patency of the treated (index) site at 6 months. Primary patency is defined as less than or equal to 50% loss of luminal diameter at the treated site on angiography without re‐intervention in the interim. (3.2) Secondary outcomes: • Limb‐salvage rate of the trial leg at 3, 6 and 12 months. • Primary patency on duplex sonography of the treated (index) site at 3 months. • Clinical categorisation of the treated ischemic leg by means of the Rutherford classification at 3, 6 and 12 months. • Minor amputation (below the ankle excluding the toes) of the trial leg at 3, 6 and 12 months. • Infrapopliteal surgical bypass of the trial leg at 3, 6 and 12 months. • Infrapopliteal endovascular re‐intervention of the trial leg at 3, 6 and 12 months. • Primary patency of treated femoropopliteal sites, if applicable. • Peri‐procedural (within 30 days) complications. • Death. • Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) , i.e., the mean difference in costs divided by the mean difference in QALY 4. Investigational product: (4.1) Paclitaxel: Paclitaxel inhibits SMC replication in the G2/M phases, SMC migration and extracellular matrix formation, thus inhibiting neointima formation. Neointima formation causes restenosis. (4.2) Drug eluting balloon: A drug‐eluting balloon (DEB) is a paclitaxel‐coated peripheral angioplasty balloon catheter specifically designed for PTA of small peripheral atherosclerotic obstructed arteries. DEBs are available in different sizes of 2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 3.5mm and 4mm in diameter and 40mm, 80mm and 120mm in length. The DEBs are coated with a proprietary hydrophilic formulation of paclitaxel with a matrix substance. Paclitaxel coated DEB are currently registered in Singapore for use. Protocol 1. Randomisation: Patients will be randomized to either DEB‐PTA or CB‐PTA after the lesion has been crossed with the guidewire. The allocation ratio will be 1:1. Randomization will be stratified by diabetes and renal failure status. Patients will be blinded to the assigned treatment. The operators from SGH and TTSH site will perform the angioplasty and angiogram procedures. The operators who perform angiogram at 6 month follow‐up will be blinded to the treatment arm to prevent bias. For the reading of the images, the radiologists who read those images will also be blinded to prevent bias. 2. Procedure Following antegrade or retrograde femoral puncture and insertion of an arterial sheath with a haemostatic valve, angiography is performed. Angiographic features of the lesion(s) are then assessed. If endovascular treatment is not considered feasible, the patient is excluded from the study. (3) DEB‐PTA arm (4) CB‐PTA arm (5) Morphologic lesion classification: Morphologic lesion classification on angiography will be performed according to the Transatlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) document on management of peripheral arterial disease: TASC Type A infrapopliteal lesions: 1. Single stenoses shorter than 1 cm in the tibial or peroneal vessels. TASC Type B infrapopliteal lesions: 2. Multiple focal stenoses of the tibial or peroneal vessel, each less than 1 cm in length. 1. Study design: This is an investigator‐initiated multi‐center, prospective, randomised, controlled, two‐arm parallel‐group study. The participating centers will be Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Patients are eligible for enrolment if they have CLI and at least one infragenicular lesion with a maximal total lesion length of 20cm. Randomisation will be performed on a 1:1 ratio to either DEB PTA or CB PTA. Patients will be assessed prior and directly after the intervention, at 3, 6 and 12 months by Rutherford classification, ankle‐brachial index, toe pressure and adverse events. Duplex will be performed at 3 months. Angiography will be performed before and directly after PTA and at 6 months. Primary end‐point will be primary patency of the treated lesions at 6 months on angiography (defined as <50% stenosis, without re‐intervention in the interim). Secondary end‐points are limb salvage at 3, 6 and 12 months, primary patency of the treated lesion on Duplex at 3 months (defined as patency of the treated artery with peak systolic velocity (PSV) ≤2.0 m/sec), Rutherford classification, minor and major amputation, infrapopliteal endovascular re‐intervention, patency of treated femoropopliteal sites (if applicable), infrapopliteal surgical bypass, peri‐procedural complications and death at 3, 6 and 12 months. A cost‐effectiveness analysis will be performed alongside the 3‐year randomized clinical trial of DEB PTA versus the CB‐ PTA. Both cost and utility outcomes will be determined from data sampled from the patient enrolled in the study and will be estimated using comparable time horizons. The time horizon of the economic analysis is 12 months, from the patient's study inclusion up to 12 months after PTA. Analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Direct healthcare and non‐health care costs incurred will be presented in 2013 Singapore dollars (SGD). Hospitalization costs will be determined from cumulative hospital billing data. Other healthcare costs outside SGH/TTSH and indirect costs will be determined by patient surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months post‐procedure. Information on Qualify of Life (QoL) will be measured using the EQ‐5D‐3L (at baseline, 3 months‐, 6 months‐ and 12‐ months) and used to calculate Quality‐Adjusted Life Years (QALY) after incorporating mortality. The lesion is crossed under fluoroscopic guidance with the combination of a catheter and guidewire according to the choice of the operator. Following lesion crossing the patient will be randomised to receive either DEB‐PTA or CB‐PTA. If crossing of the lesion is unsuccessful, the patient will not be randomized. After successful crossing of the target lesion, a conventional angioplasty balloon with a diameter matching the target vessel is advanced over the guidewire and is inflated at the target lesion site, according to the normal practice of the operator. Comparisons of pre‐ and post‐implantation percent stenosis will be made in the same angiographic projection(s). Whenever stent placement is required as a 'bail‐out' in cases of post‐PTA occlusion or flow‐limiting dissection, a bare metal (non‐drug eluting) stent will be used. 3. One or two focal stenoses, each less than 1 cm long, at the tibial trifurcation. 4. Short tibial or peroneal stenosis in conjunction with femoropopliteal PTA. TASC Type C infrapopliteal lesions: 5. Stenoses 1‐4 cm in length. 6. Occlusions 1‐2 cm in length of the tibial or peroneal vessels. 7. Extensive stenoses of the tibial trifurcation. TASC Type D infrapopliteal lesions: 8. Tibial or peroneal occlusions longer than 2 cm. 9. Diffusely diseased tibial or peroneal vessels. After successful crossing of the target lesion, angioplasty with a conventional angioplasty balloon is performed before DEB‐PTA. A conventional angioplasty balloon with a diameter 0.5mm less than the intended DEB balloon is advanced over the guidewire and is inflated at the trial lesion site, according to the normal practice of the operator. A DEB with a diameter matching the target vessel and lesion length is then advanced over the 0.018 inch guidewire and inflated at the target lesion site for 60 seconds. If the lesion length is longer than the length of the balloon, a second inflation with another DEB will be required. The maximal total lesion length of the treated lesions will not exceed 20cm, as this is the maximal length that can be treated with two DEBs. Comparisons of pre‐ and post‐implantation percent stenosis will be made in the same angiographic projection(s). Whenever stent placement is required as 'bail‐out' in cases of post‐PTA occlusion or flow‐limiting dissection, a bare metal (non‐drug eluting) stent will be used. TASC classification is done for investigational purposes only and it does not influence treatment in this study. (6) The following information relating to the procedure is collected: ‐ General participant demographics (initials, subject‐number, date of birth, gender) ‐ Number of lesions ‐ Location of each lesion ‐ TASC morphology classification ‐ Contrast medium type and amount administered ‐ Type and size of sheaths, guidewires and catheters ‐ Diameters of non‐diseased arterial lumen proximal and distal to the target site for each treated lesion ‐ Percentage stenosis of the lesion before and after treatment for each lesion ‐ Lesion length prior to treatment for each treated lesion ‐ Quality of runoff (number of vessels and presence of stenoses or occlusion) distal to the target site before and after treatment ‐ Type, size, length and number of balloon used/ Numbers of stents used ‐ Presence or absence of complications ‐ Use of closure‐device (if used, type) (7) Escape procedure: In case stent placement is required to treat dissections proximal, distal or at the site of the treated lesion, the operator must consider the best interest of the patient. Patients should receive bare metal (non‐drug eluting) stents if 'bail‐out' stenting is required due to post‐PTA occlusion or flow‐limiting dissection, as is common practice. In cases of acute arterial thrombosis or embolism, on table or infusional thrombolysis (using urokinase or rTPA) or mechanical thrombectomy is permitted according to the preference of the operator and the local hospital protocol. (8) End of the procedure The procedure is considered complete once all the delivery material including catheter sheath introducer has been removed. (9) Anti‐platelet medication The following anti‐thrombotic medications are to be administered. ‐ During the procedure, at least 2000 units of heparin are administered intravenously or intra‐arterially. If necessary this dose may be increased or repeated in cases of prolonged procedures ‐ Overnight treatment with heparin is permitted ‐ Clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be administered for at least 6 months following the procedure ‐ Aspirin 100 mg daily should be administered for at least 12 months following the procedure. Follow Up All patients will be evaluated prior to hospital discharge, at 3 months (± 14 days), 6 months (± 14 days) and at 12 months (± 30 days) post‐procedure, or upon return of complaints. All patients will be followed during a 12 month follow‐up period. They will be seen for duplex sonography at 3 months or upon return of complaints. Angiography is performed at 6 months. All reported AEs and SAEs will be followed‐up and closed. SCRI will keep an electronic SAE tracking log at SCRI to track all reported SAEs. This is to ensure that the SAE is followed until it is resolved and reported to the accredited IRB.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",,Albumin‐Bound Paclitaxel;Ischemia;Paclitaxel;Peripheral Arterial Disease;Peripheral Vascular Diseases,,,Double_Check,No notes extracted.,No reasoning extracted.,Excluded,Disagree

BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel-coated balloon treatment prevents reinterventions, but dose and coating characteristics differ among balloons and necessitate discrete confirmation of safety and effectiveness. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford classification 2 to 4) were randomized 3:1 to treatment with the Ranger DCB or standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Twelve-month primary target lesion patency, freedom from major adverse events (i.e., target lesion revascularization, major amputations, death within 1 month of the index procedure), and patient outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean lesion length was 82.5 ± 48.9 mm for the Ranger DCB group (n = 278) and 79.9 ± 49.3 mm for the control group (n = 98). Ranger DCB was superior to PTA (82.9% [n = 194 of 234] vs. 66.3% [n = 57 of 86]) with observed 12-month primary patency rates yielding a difference of 16.6% (95% confidence interval: 5.5% to 27.7%; p = 0.0013). Noninferior freedom from major adverse events (94.1% [n = 241 of 256] vs. 83.5% [n = 76 of 91]) was demonstrated with a difference of 10.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.5% to 18.8%; noninferiority p < 0.0001).

The device system is designed to treat vascular dissections in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. Tack implants exert low radial force and are associated with minimal metal burden, which reduces the mechanical stress on the arterial wall in treating dissections after balloon angioplasty. This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of the Tack Endovascular System in patients with dissections after drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty. METHODS: The Tack Optimized Balloon Angioplasty III (TOBA III) study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study in which patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with the Medtronic IN.PACT Admiral DCB (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) and experienced dissection after angioplasty were treated with Tack implants. The primary end points were freedom from major adverse events at 30 days and primary patency at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients were enrolled in the trial, 169 with standard-length lesions (≥20 mm and ≤150 mm) and 32 with long-length lesions (>150 mm and ≤250 mm). Safety and effectiveness results were favorable compared with historical benchmarks at 12 months in the standard-lesion cohort. Notably, patients in the standard-lesion cohort experienced 95.0% primary patency, 97.5% freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization, 100% freedom from amputation, and 100% survival at 12 months (P < .0001). Primary patency in long-lesion patients was 89.3%, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.8%, and freedom from amputation was 100% at 12 months. Device success was achieved in 95.8% (182/190) and 97.7% (43/44) of devices deployed into standard-lesion and long-lesion patients, respectively. Procedural success was 99.4% (168/169) and 100% (44/44) in the standard-lesion and long-lesion cohorts, respectively, with only one bailout stent placed in the entire population.

Recently, introduction of drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty as a superior treatment option to plain balloon (PB) has been challenging. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of DCB versus PB angioplasty in chronic lower extremity ischemia patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial, 2 groups were matched at baseline; among 68 patients with peripheral artery disease, 23 patients were treated by DCB and 45 by PB. They were followed up for 6 months. Our findings of ABI, Rutherford and WIFI class changes, mortality, limb amputation, re-intervention and primary patency (PP) were collected and analyzed in comparative fashion between 2 groups. RESULTS: Mean patients age was 68.5 years (77.9% male). At 6 months, the increase in ABI in DCB was 0.37 and in PB was 0.32 (P>0.05). Mean decrease in Rutherford class in DCB and PB were 2.56, 2.28 (P>0.05). Mean decrease in WIFI class in DCB and PB were 1.48, 1.11 (P>0.05). In DCB group, 1 (4.3%) limb amputation, 3 (13%) re-interventions and no mortality with 87% PP were seen. In PB group, 2 (4.4%) limb amputation, 7 (15.6%) re-interventions, 1 (2.2%) mortality with 84.4% PP were seen. CONCLUSION: Treatment of occlusive lesions of SFA with DCB probably may leads to improvement in ABI, Rutherford and WIFI class, higher pp and lower rate of re-interventions. Since Rutherford class and pp in DCB group have improved during 6 months compared to 1 month follow up (in our study), this improvement seems to be more significant statistically in longer term of follow up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""RCT, DCB vs PTA, SFA lesions, FU 6 months, outcomes Amputations and Rutherford classification assessed.""]}",10.2147/IJGM.S256240,,32982378.0,PMC7501961,Excluded,"The study is described as a ""clinical trial"" but does not explicitly state randomization, only that groups were ""matched at baseline,"" raising concerns about non-randomized design.","The following criteria were checked: 1.

The Tack Optimized Balloon Angioplasty (TOBA) III trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Tack Endovascular System in patients with superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA) dissection after PTA with a drug-coated balloon (DCB). The objective of this study is to report the results in the standard- (SL) and long-lesion (LL) cohorts through 24 months. DESIGN: The TOBA III study was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study including patients suffering from Rutherford category 2-4 PAD. Outcomes were assessed according to pre-specified lesion length in SL ( ≥ 20 mm and ≤150 mm) and LL ( > 150 mm and ≤250 mm) cohorts. Follow-up was through 24 months. RESULTS: TOBA III enrolled 201 patients, 169 patients in the SL cohort and 32 in the LL cohort. At 24 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from major adverse events were 91.7% and 82.6% for the SL cohort and LL cohort, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from clinically driven-target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) were 92.3% in the SL cohort and 82.6% in the LL cohort. At 24 months, 78.8% of SL patients and 69.2% of LL patients experienced an improvement of >2 Rutherford categories (both cohorts p < 0.001).

BACKGROUND: Several randomized controlled studies evaluating various DCBs have demonstrated a significantly higher patency rate compared with noncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloons at 1 year. However, the data are limited and vary by DCB at longer follow-up time points. An earlier generation low-dose DCB failed to demonstrate significant treatment effect at 2 years, raising questions regarding the durability of low-dose DCBs. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter trial, 294 patients were randomized (3:1) to treatment with a DCB or an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon. Assessments at 2 years included primary patency with duplex ultrasonography, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Primary patency at 2 years was significantly higher in the DCB cohort (75.9% vs. 61.0%; p = 0.025), and the rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower (12.1% vs. 30.5%; p < 0.001). There were no major limb amputations in either group. The rates of all-cause (6.5% vs. 5.1%; p = 1.00) and cardiovascular-related (1.6% vs. 1.7%; p = 1.00) mortality were similar between groups. Functional improvements over baseline were sustained in both groups, with 60% fewer reinterventions in the DCB group. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained treatment effect is achievable with a low-dose DCB with an optimized coating formulation.

The primary study enrolled 204 patients with stenosis or occlusion in the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery. Patients were randomized to primary nitinol stenting followed by standard PTA or primary nitinol stenting followed by FREEWAY™ paclitaxel-eluting balloon PTA. METHODS: Previous patients were recontacted by phone or during a routine hospital visit, and medical records were reviewed. Vital and clinical status information was collected. RESULTS: No increased late mortality was observed at 5 years, with an all-cause mortality rate of 12.0% in the FREEWAY drug-eluting balloon group versus 15.0% in the non-paclitaxel PTA group. No accumulation of any cause of death was observed in either group, nor was there any correlation with the dose of paclitaxel used. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 5 years was significantly higher in the FREEWAY drug eluting balloon group (85.3%) compared to standard PTA group (72.7%) Log-rank p = 0.032.

Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS: Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, P=0.009) or DA (55±29%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.

Freedom from target lesion revascularization was 96.4% versus 81.0% (P=0.0117) at 6 months and 90.8% versus 52.6% (P<0.0001) at 12 months, respectively. At 12 months, clinical improvement by ≥1 Rutherford category without the need for target lesion revascularization was observed in 35 of 45 DCBA patients (77.8%) and 23 of 44 POBA patients (52.3%; P=0.015). No major amputation was needed. Two patients in the DCBA and 3 patients in the POBA group died. No death was procedure related. CONCLUSIONS: DCBA for superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis is associated with less recurrent restenosis and a better clinical outcome than POBA without an apparent difference in safety.

Vessel preparation prior to angioplasty may improve immediate results of the angioplasty and long-term patency. This prospective study assessed the 12-month outcomes of patients who underwent novel vessel preparation catheter, the FLEX Vessel Prep™ System (FLEX VP), prior to drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB-PTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This investigator-initiated single-arm prospective trial enrolled patients with symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease with de novo, restenotic, or in-stent stenosis of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. Target lesions were prepared using FLEX VP that created 12 longitudinal micro-incisions before drug-coated balloon angioplasty. RESULTS: Forty-three lesions in 41 patients were treated in this study with an average lesion length of 118 mm (10-291 mm), average stenosis of 82% (40-100%), and an occlusion rate of 27.9% with an average occlusion length of 89 mm (10-272 mm). Calcification was observed in 85.7% of the lesions, with 66.7% of lesions demonstrating grade 3 or 4 of the Peripheral Arterial Calcification Scoring System. After FLEX VP and DCB-PTA, 92.7% of patients were absent of flow-limiting dissections. Stenting occurred in 39% (16/41) patients (median stent length 40 mm) for residual stenosis (15 patients) and flow-limiting dissection (1 patient). There was one death prior to the 12-month follow-up, not related to the index procedure. Freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months was 97.5% (39/40). Rutherford classification shifted from 41.5% Class ≥3 at baseline to 95% Class ≤1 at 12 months. There were no amputations at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Vessel preparation with longitudinal micro-incisions of complex and calcified lesions prior to angioplasty was associated with few flow-limiting dissections. The majority of stents were placed to treat focal residual stenosis, using the shortest available stent length at the time of the study (40 mm) for the majority. Only one stent was needed to treat a flow-limiting dissection. The 97.5% freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CDTLR) and symptom relief at 12 months suggest that vessel preparation via FLEX VP provides value in maintaining long-term outcomes in patients with highly calcified superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal lesions. CLINICAL IMPACT: Vessel preparation with longitudinal micro-incisions is a short and efficient intervention associated with promising clinical outcomes and patency rate 12 months after treatment of long and calcified occlusions or stenosis of the femoral and popliteal arteries. This innovative vessel preparation provides post-procedure less residual stenosis and more favorable dissection morphology, decreasing the placement of stent and especially their length. Vessel preparation by longitudinal incisions also favors optimal distribution of anti-restenotic drug in the lesion and thus prevents further intervention due to restenosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | USER-NOTES: {""Benedetta""=>[""single arm, wrong drug""]}",10.1177/15266028241312346,,39825720.0,,Excluded,Not an RCT and lacks explicit DCB vs POBA comparison; single-arm trial testing vessel preparation prior to DCB without对照组.,"The following criteria were checked: 1.

METHODS: Among 448 CLI patients treated from December 2009 to March 2011, 48 patients (39 men; mean age 72.7±7.8 years) with chronic SFA in-stent occlusion were randomly assigned to treatment using LD+DEB (n=24) or DEB angioplasty alone (n=24). Patency at 12 months was the primary outcome measure; secondary outcomes were target lesion revascularization (TLR) and clinical success at 12 months. RESULTS: In the LD+DEB group, the patency rates at 6 and 12 months (91.7% and 66.7%, respectively) were significantly higher (p=0.01) than in the DEB only patients (58.3% and 37.5%, respectively). TLR at 12 months was 16.7% in the LD+DEB group and 50% in the DEB only group (p=0.01). Two (8%) patients needed major amputations in the LD+DEB group vs. 11 (46%) in the DEB only group at 12 months (p=0.003).

The RAPID Trial investigates the added value of drug coated balloons (DCB, Legflow) in a primary stenting strategy (Supera stent) for intermediate (5-15 cm) and long segment (>15 cm) SFA lesions. METHODS: In this multicenter, patient-blinded trial, 160 patients with intermittent claudication, ischemic rest pain, or tissue loss due to intermediate or long SFA lesions were randomized (1:1) between Supera + DCB and Supera. Primary endpoint was primary patency at 2 years, defined as freedom from restenosis on duplex ultrasound (peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4). RESULTS: At 2 years, primary patency was 55.1% (95% CI: 43.1-67.1%) in the Supera + DCB group versus 48.3% (95% CI: 35.6-61.0%) in the Supera group (P=0.957). Per protocol analysis showed a primary patency rate of 60.9% (95% CI: 48.6-73.2%) in the Supera + DCB group versus 49.8% (95% CI: 36.9-62.7%) in the Supera group (P=0.469). The overall mortality rate was 5% in both groups (P=0.975). Sustained functional improvement was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-year results in the current trial of a primary Supera stenting strategy are consistent with other trials reporting on treatment of intermediate and long SFA lesions.

Recent data indicate that an endovascular option is feasible in treating CFA disease but there remains significant controversy about the endovascular versus surgical approach to treatment. Newer modalities of therapy have emerged to treat the CFA including atherectomy and drug coated balloons. We retrospectively reviewed data on the long-term outcome of endovascular treatment of CFA from 2 medical centers. METHODS: Consecutive patients with CFA disease treated by 6 operators using endovascular techniques from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017 were reviewed and analyzed. Two-year follow up was completed using medical records. Demographic, clinical, procedural and angiographic variables were collected. The primary endpoint of the study was target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints included target vessel revascularization (TVR), mortality, unplanned major and minor amputations and 30-day periprocedural adverse events. Descriptive analysis was performed on all variables. Kaplan-Meier for freedom from TLR was plotted. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at our center. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients (116 limbs) were included at Index. There were males 57.3%, diabetics 42.7%. Mean age was 65.1 ± 16.3 years. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was present in 27.7%. Disease distribution was classified by the Medina classification: 1-0-0 (CFA only) 48.3%, 1-0-1 (CFA + profunda) 6.9%, 1-1-1 (CFA+ profunda + origin of superficial femoral artery) 16.4%, 1-1-0 (CFA and origin of SFA) 28.4%. Denovo disease was present in 70.7%. Atherectomy was used in 104/116 limbs (89.7%). Drug coated balloons (DCB) in 15.5%, and stenting in 22.4%. Baseline stenosis 81.2 ± 13.1%, lesion length was 42.0 ± 14.5 mm. Final stenosis was 13.3 ± 11.0. Major bleeding occurred in 2.6%. At 2-year mortality was 9.0% (none related to procedure), CLI was 5.9% and no unplanned major or minor amputations. At 2-year KM analysis showed a probability of freedom from TLR of 72.2%. At 2-year the following TLRs were noted for various devices used: PTA 50%, orbital atherectomy 0%, jetstream 29.2%, laser 36.4%, and SilverHawk/TurboHawk 23.1% (p = 0.0476). CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of CFA predominantly with atherectomy in this cohort, is feasible and with acceptable outcomes considering a low percentage of DCB use. A randomized trial is needed to validate these findings and explore the added role of DCB and atherectomy on clinical outcomes when compared to endarterectomy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Benedetta""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design",10.1016/j.carrev.2020.09.006,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;*Angioplasty, Balloon/adverse effects;Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnostic imaging/surgery;Popliteal Artery;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Vascular Patency",32921595.0,,Excluded,"Observational study comparing multiple devices, not an RCT of DCB vs POBA.","The following criteria were checked: 1.
